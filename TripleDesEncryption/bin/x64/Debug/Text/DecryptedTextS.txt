 THE WELL OF ETERNITY
 ONE
 The tall, forbidding palace perched atop the very edge of the mountainous cliff, overlooking so
precariously the vast, black body of water below that it appeared almost ready to plummet into the
latter’s dark depths. When first the vast, walled edifice had been constructed, using magic that melded
both stone and forest into a single, cohesive form, it had been a wonder to touch the heart of any who
saw it. Its towers were trees strengthened by rock, with jutting spires and high, open windows. The walls
were volcanic stone raised up, then bound tightly by draping vines and giant roots. The main palace at the
center had originally been created by the mystical binding of more than a hundred giant, ancient trees.
Bent in together, they had formed the skeleton of the rounded center, over which the stone and vines had
been set.
 A wonder to touch the hearts of all when first it had been built, now it touched the fears of some. An
unsettling aura enshrouded it, one heightened this stormy night. The few who peered at the ancient edifice
now quickly averted their gaze.
 Those who looked instead to the waters below it found no peace, either. The ebony lake was now in
violent, unnatural turmoil. Churning waves as high as the palace rose and fell in the distance, crashing with
a roar. Lightning played over its vast body, lightning gold, crimson, or the green of decay. Thunder
rumbled like a thousand dragons and those who lived around its shores huddled close, uncertain as to
what sort of storm might be unleashed.
 On the walls surrounding the palace, ominous guards in forest-green armor and wielding lances and
swords glared warily about. They watched not only beyond the walls for foolish trespassers, but on
occasion surreptitiously glanced within…particularly at the main tower, where they sensed unpredictable
energies at play.
 And in that high tower, in a stone chamber sealed from the sight of those outside, tall, narrow figures in
iridescent robes of turquoise, embroidered with stylized, silver images of nature, bent over a six-sided
pattern written into the floor. At the center of the pattern, symbols in a language archaic even to the
wielders flared with lives of their own.
 Glittering, silver eyes with no pupils stared out from under the hoods as the night elves muttered the spell.
Their dark, violet skin grew covered in sweat as the magic within the pattern amplified. All but one
looked weary, ready to succumb to exhaustion. That one, overseeing the casting, watched the process
not with silver orbs like the rest, but rather false black ones with streaks of ruby running horizontal along
the centers. But despite the false eyes, he noted every detail, every inflection by the others. His long,
narrow face, narrow even for an elf, wore an expression of hunger and anticipation as he silently drove
them on.
 One other watched all of this, drinking in every word and gesture. Seated on a luxurious chair of ivory
and leather, her rich, silver hair framing her perfect features and the silken gown—as golden as her
eyes—doing the same for her exquisite form, she was every inch the vision of a queen. She leaned back
against the chair, sipping wine from a golden goblet. Her jeweled bracelets tinkled as her hand moved
and the ruby in the tiara she wore glistened in the light of the sorcerous energies the others had
summoned.
 Now and then her gaze shifted ever so slightly to study the dark-eyed figure, her full lips pursing in
something approaching suspicion. Yet, when once he suddenly glanced her way, as if sensing her
observation, all suspicion vanished, replaced by a languid smile.
 The chanting continued.
 The black lake churned madly.

 There had been a war and it had ended.
 So, Krasus knew, history would eventually record what had happened. Almost lost in that recording
would be the countless personal lives destroyed, the lands ravaged, and the near-destruction of the entire
mortal world.
 Even the memories of dragons are fleeting under such circumstances,the pale, gray-robed figure
conceded to himself. He understood that very well, for although to most eyes he resembled a lanky,
almost elven figure with hawklike features, silvering hair, and three long scars traveling down his right
cheek, he was much more than that. To most, he was known as a wizard, but to a select few he was
calledKorialstrasz —a name only a dragon would wear.
 Krasus had been born a dragon, a majestic red one, the youngest of the great Alexstrasza’s consorts.
She, the Aspect of Life, was his dearest companion…yet once again he dragged himself away from her
to study the plights and futures of the short-lived races.
 In the hidden, rock-hewn abode he had chosen for his new sanctum, Krasus looked over the world of
Azeroth. The gleaming emerald crystal enabled him to see whatever land, whatever individual, he desired.
 And everywhere that the dragon mage looked, he saw devastation.
 It seemed as if it had only been a few years ago when the grotesque, green-skinned behemoths called
orcs, who had invaded the world from beyond, were defeated. With their remaining numbers kept in
encampments, Krasus had believed the world ready for peace. Yet, that peace had been short-lived. The
Alliance—the human-led coalition that had been the forefront of the resistance—had immediately begun
to crumble, its members vying for power over one another. Part of that had been the fault of dragons—or
theone dragon, Deathwing—but much had simply been the greed and desire of humans, dwarves, and
elves.
 Yet, even that would have passed with little concern if not for the coming of the Burning Legion.
 Today, Krasus surveyed distant Kalimdor, located on the far side of the sea. Even now, areas of it
resembled a land after a terrible volcanic eruption. No life, no semblance of civilization, remained in those
areas. It had not been any natural force, however, that had rent the land so. The Burning Legion had left
nothing in its wake but death.
 The fiery demons had come from a place beyond reality. Magic was what they sought, magic they
devoured. Attacking in conjunction with their monstrous pawns, the Undead Scourge, they had thought
to lay waste to the world. Yet, they had not counted on the most unlikely alliance of all…
 The orcs, once also their puppets, had turned on them. They had joined the humans, elves, dwarves, and
dragons to decimate the demonic warriors and ghoulish beasts and push the remnants back into the
hellish beyond. Thousands had perished, but the alternative…
 The dragon mage snorted. In truth, there had beenno alternative.
 Krasus waved long, tapering fingers over the orb, summoning a vision of the orcs. The view blurred
momentarily, then revealed a mountainous, rocky area further inland. A harsh land, but one still full of life
and capable of supporting the new colonists.
 Already, several stone structures had risen in the main settlement, where the Warchief and one of the
heroes of the war, Thrall, ruled. The high, rounded edifice that served as his quarters was crude by the
standards of any other race, but orcs had a propensity toward basics. Extravagance to an orc was having
a permanent place to live at all. They had been nomads or prisoners for so long that the concept of
“home” had been all but lost.
 Several of the massive, greenish figures tilled a field. Watching the tusked, brutish-looking workers,
Krasus marveled at the concept of orc farmers. Thrall, however, was a highly unusual orc and he had
readily grasped the ideas that would return stability to his people.
 Stability was something the entire world needed badly. With another wave of his hand, the dragon mage
dismissed Kalimdor, summoning now a much closer location—the once proud capital of his favored
Dalaran. Ruled by the wizards of the Kirin Tor, the prime wielders of magic, it had been at the forefront
of the Alliance’s battle against the Burning Legion in Lordaeron and one of the first and most prized
targets of the demons in turn.
 Dalaran lay half in ruins. The once-proud spires had been all but shattered. The great libraries burned.
Countless generations of knowledge had been lost…and with them countless lives. Even the council had
suffered badly. Several of those Krasus had counted as friends or at least respected colleagues had been
slain. The leadership was in disarray and he knew that he would have to step in to lend a hand. Dalaran
needed to speak with one voice, if only to keep what remained of the splintered Alliance intact.
 Yet, despite the turmoil and tribulations still ahead, the dragon did have hope. The problems of the world
were surmountable ones. No more fear of orcs, no more fear of demons. Azeroth would struggle, but in
the end, Krasus not only thought it would survive, he fully believed it would thrive.
 He dismissed the emerald crystal and rose. The Dragon Queen, his beloved Alexstrasza, would be
awaiting him. She suspected his desire to return to help the mortal world and, of all dragons, she most
understood. He would transform to his true self, bid her farewell—for a time—and depart before regrets
held him back.
 His sanctum he had chosen not only for its seclusion, but also for its massiveness. Stepping from the
smaller chamber, Krasus entered a toothy cavern whose heights readily matched the now lost towers of
Dalaran. An army could have bivouacked in the cavern and not filled it.
 Just the right size for a dragon.
 Krasus stretched his arms…and as he did, his tapering fingers lengthened further, becoming taloned. His
back arched and from near the shoulders erupted twin growths that quickly transformed into fledgling
wings. His long features stretched, turning reptilian.
 Throughout all these lesser changes, Krasus’s form expanded. He became four, five, even ten times the
size of a man and continued to grow. Any semblance to a human or elf quickly faded.
 From wizard, Krasus became Korialstrasz, dragon.
 But—in the very midst of the transformation—a desperate voice suddenly filled his head.
 Kor…strasz…
 He faltered, all but reverting to his wizardly form. Krasus blinked, then stared around the huge chamber
as if seeking the source of the cry there.
 Nothing. The dragon mage waited and waited, but the call did not repeat.
 Shrugging it off to his own uncertainties, he commenced again with the transformation—
 And again, the desperate voice criedKorialstra…
 This time…he recognized it. Immediately, he responded in kind.I hear you! What is it you need of me?
 There was no response, but Krasus sensed the desperation remaining. Focusing, he tried to reach out,
establish a link with the one who so badly needed his aid—the one who should have needed no aid from
any creature.
 I am here!the dragon mage demanded.Sense me! Give me some indication of what is wrong!
 He felt the barest touch in return, a faint hinting of some distress. Krasus concentrated every iota of his
thoughts into the meager link, hoping…hoping…
 The overpowering presence of a dragon whose magic dwarfed his own a thousandfold sent Krasus
staggering. A sensation of centuries, of great age, engulfed him. Krasus felt as if Time itself now
surrounded him in all its terrible majesty.
 Not Time…not quite…but he who was the Aspect of Time.
 The Dragon of the Ages…Nozdormu.
 There were only four great dragons, four Great Aspects, of which his beloved Alexstrasza was Life.
Mad Malygos was Magic and ethereal Ysera influenced Dreams. They, along with brooding Nozdormu,
represented creation itself.
 Krasus grimaced. In truth, there had beenfive Aspects. The fifth had once been called Neltharion…the
Earth Warder. But long ago, in a time even Krasus could not recall clearly, Neltharion had betrayed his
fellows. The Earth Warder had turned on them and in the process had garnered a new, more appropriate
title.
 Deathwing. The Destroyer.
 The very thought of Deathwing stirred Krasus from his astonishment. He absently touched the three
scars on his cheek. Had Deathwing returned to plague the world again? Was that why the great
Nozdormu would show such distress?
 I hear you!Krasus mentally called back, now more than ever fearful of the reason for the call.I hear you!
Is it—is it the Destroyer?
 But in response, he was once again buffeted by an overwhelming series of astonishing images. The
images burnt themselves into his head, making it impossible for Krasus to ever forget any.
 In either form, Krasus, however adaptable and capable, was no match for the unbridled power of an
Aspect. The force of the other dragon’s mental might flung him back against the nearest wall, where the
mage collapsed.
 It took several minutes for Krasus to push himself up from the floor and even then his head spun.
Fragmented thoughts not his own assailed his senses. It was all he could do for a time just to remain
conscious.
 Slowly, though, things stabilized enough for him to realize the scope of all that had just happened.
Nozdormu, Lord of Time, had been desperately crying out for aid…hisaid. He had turned specifically to
the lesser dragon, not one of his compatriots.
 But anything that would so distress an Aspect could only be a monumental threat to the rest of Azeroth.
Why then choose a lone red dragon and not Alexstrasza or Ysera?
 He tried once more to reach the great dragon, but his efforts only made his head swim again. Steadying
himself, Krasus tried to decide what to do instead. One image in particular constantly demanded his
attention, the image of a snow-swept mountain area in Kalimdor. Whatever Nozdormu had sought to
explain to him had to do with that desolate region.
 Krasus would have to investigate it, but he would need capable assistance, someone who could adapt
readily. While Krasus prided himself on his own ability to adapt well, his species was, for the most part,
obstinate and set in its ways. He needed someone who would listen, but who could also react instantly as
unfolding events required. No, for such unpredictable effort, only one creature would serve. A human.
 In particular, a human named Rhonin.
 A wizard…

 And in Kalimdor, on the steppes of the wild country, a grizzled, aged orc leaned close over a smoky
fire. Mumbling words whose origins lay on another, long-lost world, the moss-green figure tossed some
leaves upon the fire, increasing the already thick smoke. Fumes filled his humble wood and earth hut.
 The bald, elderly orc leaned over and inhaled. His weary brown eyes were veined and his skin hung in
sacks. His teeth were yellow, chipped, and one of his tusks had been broken off years before. He could
scarcely rise without aid and when he walked, he did so stooped and slow.
 Yet, even the hardiest warrior paid him fealty as shaman.
 A bit of bone dust, a touch of tannar berries…all part of a tried and true tradition resurrected among the
orcs. Kalthar’s father had taught him all even during the dark years of the Horde, just as Kalthar’s
grandsire had taught his father before that.
 And now, for the first time, the withered shaman found himself hoping he had been taught well.
 Voices murmured in his head, the spirits of the world that the orcs now called home. Normally, they
whispered little things, life things, but now they murmured anxiously, warning…warning…
 But of what? He had to know more.
 Kalthar reached into a pouch at his waist, removing three dried, black leaves. They were almost all of
what remained from a single plant brought with him from the orcs’ ancient world. Kalthar had been
warned not to use them unless he deemed it truly necessary. His father had never used them, nor his
grandfather.
 The shaman tossed them into the flames.
 Instantly the smoke turned a thick, swirling blue. Not black, but blue. The orc’s brow furrowed at this
change of color, then he leaned forward again and inhaled as much as possible.
 The world transformed, and with it the orc. He had become a bird, a huge avian soaring over the
landscape. He flew over mountains without a care. With his eyes he saw the tiniest animals, the most
distant rivers. A sense of exhilaration not felt since his youth almost overwhelmed Kalthar, but he fought
it. To give in would risk him losing his sense of self. He might fly forever as a bird, never knowing what he
had once been.
 Even as he thought that, Kalthar suddenly noted a wrongness in the nature of the world, possibly the
reason for the voices’ concern. Somethingwas that should not be. He veered in the direction that felt
correct, growing more anxious as he drew nearer.
 And just within the deepest part of the mountain range, the shaman discovered the source of his anxiety.
 His learned mind knew that he envisioned a concept, not the actual thing. To Kalthar, it appeared as a
water funnel—yet one that swallowed and disgorged simultaneously. But what emerged or sank into its
depths were days and nights, months and years. The funnel seemed to be eating and emitting time itself.
 The notion so staggered the shaman that he did not notice until almost too late that the funnel now sought
to drawhim in as well.
 Immediately, Kalthar strained to free himself. He flapped his wings, pushed with his muscles. His mind
reached out to his physical form, tugging hard at the gossamer link tying body to soul and trying to break
the trance.
 Still the funnel drew him forward.
 In desperation, Kalthar called upon the spirit guides, prayed to them to strengthen him. They came as he
knew they would, but at first they seemed to act too slow. The funnel filled his view, seemed ready to
engulf him—
 The world abruptly twisted around the shaman. The funnel, the mountains…everything turned about and
about.
 With a gasp, Kalthar awoke.
 Exhausted beyond his years, he barely kept himself from falling face first into the fire. The voices that
constantly murmured had faded away. The orc sat on the floor of his hut, trying to reassure himself that,
yes, he now existed whole in the mortal world. The spirit guides had saved him, albeit barely in time.
 But with that happy reassurance came the reminder of what he had witnessed in his vision…and what it
meant.
 “I must tell Thrall…” he muttered, forcing weary, aged legs up. “I must tell him quick…else we lose our
home…our world…again…”
 TWO
 An ominous portent,Rhonin decided, vivid green eyes gazing at the results of his divining.Any wizard
would recognize it as so.
 “Are you certain?” Vereesa called from the other room. “Have you checked your reading?”
 The red-haired mage nodded, then grimaced when he realized that of course the elf could not see him.
He would have to tell her face to face. She deserved that.I pray she is strong.
 Clad in dark blue pants and jacket, both gold-trimmed, Rhonin looked more like a politician than a mage
these days, but the past few years had demanded as much diplomacy from him as magic. Diplomacy had
never been an easy thing for him, who preferred to go charging into a situation. With his thick mane of
hair and his short beard, he had a distinct leonine appearance that so well matched his temper when
forced to parlay with pampered, arrogant ambassadors. His nose, broken long ago and never—by his
own choice—properly fixed, further added to his fiery reputation.
 “Rhonin…is there something you have not told me?”
 He could leave her waiting no longer. She had to know the truth, however terrible it might be. “I’m
coming, Vereesa.”
 Putting away his divining instruments, Rhonin took a deep breath, then rejoined the elf. Just within the
entrance, though, he paused. All Rhonin could see was her face—a beautiful, perfect oval upon which
had been artfully placed alluring, almond-shaped eyes of pure sky blue, a tiny, upturned nose, and an
enticing mouth seemingly always halfway to a smile. Framing that face was a rich head of silver-white hair
that, had she been standing, would have hung nearly to the small of her back. She could have passed yet
for a human if not for the long, tapering ears jutting from the hair, pointed ears marking her race.
 “Well?” she asked, patiently.
 “It’s…it’s to be twins.”
 Her face lit up, if anything becoming more perfect in his eyes. “Twins! How fortuitous! How wonderful! I
was so certain!”
 She adjusted her position on the wooden bed. The slim but curved elven ranger now lay several months
pregnant. Gone were her breastplate and leather armor. Now she wore a silver gown that did not at all
conceal the imminent birth.
 They should have guessed from the quickness with which she had shown, but Rhonin had wanted to
deny it. They had been wed only a few months when she had discovered her condition. Both were
concerned then, for not only had their marriage been one so very rare in the annals of history, but no one
had ever recorded a successful human-elven birth.
 And now they expected not one child, but two.
 “I don’t think you understand, Vereesa.Twins! Twins from a mage and an elf!”
 But her face continued to radiate pleasure and wonder. “Elves seldom give birth and we very, very
rarely give birth to twins, my love! They will be destined for great things!”
 Rhonin could not hide his sour expression. “I know. That’s what worries me…”
 He and Vereesa had lived through their own share of “great things.” Thrown together to penetrate the
orc stronghold of Grim Batol during the last days of the war against the Horde, they had faced not just
orcs, but dragons, goblins, trolls, and more. Afterward, they had journeyed from realm to realm,
becoming ambassadors of sorts whose task it had been to remind the Alliance of the importance of
remaining intact. That had not meant, however, that they had not risked their lives during that time, for the
peace following that war had been unstable at best.
 Then, without warning, had come the Burning Legion.
 By that time, what had started as a partnership of two wary agents had become a binding of two unlikely
souls. In the war against the murderous demons, the mage and the ranger had fought as much for each
other as for their lands. More than once, they had thought one another dead and the pain felt had been
unbearable to each.
 Perhaps the pain of losing each other had seemed worse because of all those other loved ones who had
already perished. Both Dalaran and Quel’Thalas had been razed by the Undead Scourge, thousands
slaughtered by the decaying abominations serving the dread Lich King, who in turn served the cause of
the Legion. Entire towns perished horribly and matters were made worse by the fact that many of the
victims soon rose from the dead, their cursed mortal shells now added to the ranks of the Scourge.
 What little that remained of Rhonin’s family had perished early in the war. His mother had been long
dead, but his father, brother, and two cousins had all been slain in the fall of the city of Andorhal.
Fortunately, the desperate defenders, seeing no hope of rescue, had set the city ablaze. Even the Scourge
could not raise warriors from ash.
 He had not seen any of them—not even his father—since entering the ranks of wizardry, but Rhonin had
discovered an emptiness in his heart when the news had arrived. The rift between himself and his
kin—caused in great part because of his chosen calling—had vanished in that instant. All that had
mattered at the time was that he had become the last of his family. He was all alone.
 Alone until he realized that the feelings he had developed for the brave elven ranger at his side were
reciprocated.
 When the terrible struggle had finally played out, there had been only one logical path for the two of
them. Despite the horrified voices emanating from both Vereesa’s people and Rhonin’s wizardly masters,
the two had chosen to never be parted again. They had sealed a pact of marriage and tried to begin as
normal a life as two such as they could possibly have in a world torn asunder.
 Naturally,thought the mage bitterly,peace for us wasn’t meant to be.
 Vareesa pushed herself from the bed before he could help her. Even so near the time of birth, the elf
moved with assured swiftness. The elf took hold of Rhonin by the shoulders.
 “You wizards! Always seeing the dire! I thought my own people were so gloomy! My love, this will be a
happy birth, a happy pair of children! We will make it so!”
 He knew that she made sense. Neither would do anything that would risk the infants. When the two had
realized her condition, they ceased their own efforts to help rebuild the shattered Alliance and settled in
one of the most peaceful regions left, near enough to shattered Dalaran but not too near. They lived in a
modest but not completely humble home and the people of the nearby town respected them.
 Her confidence and hope still amazed him, considering her own losses. If Rhonin had felt a hole in his
heart after losing family he had barely known anymore, Vereesa surely had felt a gaping chasm open in
her own. Quel’Thalas, more leg endary and surely more secure than even the magic-ruled Dalaran, had
been utterly ravaged. Elven strongholds untouched by centuries had fallen in mere days, their once-proud
people added to the Scourge as easily as the mere humans. Among the latter had been included several
of Vereesa’s own close-knit clan…and a few from her very family.
 From her grandfather she had heard of his desperate battle to slay the ghoulish corpse of his own son,
her uncle. From him she had also heard how her younger brother had been ripped apart by a hungering
mob of undead led by their own elder brother, who later had been set afire and destroyed along with the
rest of the Scourge by the surviving defenders. What had happened to her parents, no one yet knew, but
they, too, were presumed dead.
 And what Rhonin had not told her…might never dare tell her…was of the monstrous rumors he had
heard concerning one of Vereesa’s two sisters, Sylvanas.
 Vereesa’s other sister, the great Alleria, had been a hero during the Second War. But Sylvanas, she
whom Rhonin’s wife had sought to emulate her entire life, had, as Ranger General, led the battle against
the betrayer—Arthas, prince of Lordaeron. Once the shining hope of his land, now the twisted servant of
the Legion and the Scourge, he had ravaged his own kingdom, then led the undead horde against the
elven capital of Silvermoon. Sylvanas had blocked his path at every juncture and for a time, it had
seemed that she would actually defeat him. But where the shambling corpses, sinister gargoyles, and
gruesome abominations had failed, the dark necromancy granted the traitorous noble had succeeded.
 The official version had Sylvanas dying valiantly as she prevented Arthas’s minions from slaying
Silvermoon’s people. The elven leaders, even Vereesa’s grandfather, claimed that the Ranger General’s
body had burned in the same fire that had devastated half the capital. Certainly there had been no trace
left.
 But while the story ended there for Vereesa, Rhonin, through sources in both the Kirin Tor and
Quel’Thalas, had discovered word of Sylvanas that left him chilled. A surviving ranger, his mind half
gone, had babbled of his general being captured, not killed. She had been horribly mutilated, then finally
slain for the pleasure of Arthas. Finally, taking her body up in the dark temple he had raised in his
madness, the prince had corrupted her soul and corpse, transforming her from heroic elf into a harbinger
of evil…a haunting, mournful phantom called a banshee that still supposedly roamed the ruins of
Quel’Thalas.
 Rhonin had so far been unable to verify the rumors, but he felt certain that they had more than a grain of
truth. He prayed that Vereesa would never hear the story.
 So many tragedies…small wonder that Rhonin could not shake his uncertainty when it came to his new
family.
 He sighed. “Perhaps when they’re born, I’ll be better. I’m likely just nervous.”
 “Which should be the sign of a caring parent.” Vereesa returned to the bed. “Besides, we are not alone
in this. Jalia aids much.”
 Jalia was an elder, full-bodied woman who had given birth to six children and midwifed several times
that number. Rhonin had been certain that a human would be leery of dealing with an elf—let alone an elf
with a wizard for a husband—but Jalia had taken one look at Vereesa and her maternal instincts had
taken over. Even though Rhonin did pay her well for her time, he very much suspected that the
townswoman would have volunteered anyway, so much had she taken to his wife.
 “I suppose you’re right,” he began. “I’ve just been—”
 A voice…a very familiar voice…suddenly filled his head.
 A voice that could not be bringing him good tidings.
 Rhonin…I have need of you.
 “Krasus?” the mage blurted.
 Vereesa sat up, all cheer vanishing. “Krasus? What about him?”
 They both knew the master wizard, a member of the Kirin Tor. Krasus had been the one instrumental in
bringing them together. He had also been the one who had not told them the entire truth about matters at
the time, especially where he himself had been concerned.
 Only through dire circumstance had they discovered that he was also the dragon Korialstrasz.
 “It’s…it’s Krasus,” was all Rhonin could say at the moment.
 Rhonin…I have need of you…
 I won’t help you!the mage instantly responded.I’ve done my share! You know I can’t leave her now…
 “What does he want?” Vereesa demanded. Like the wizard, she knew that Krasus would only contact
them if some terrible trouble had arisen.
 “It doesn’t matter! He’ll have to find someone else!”
 Before you reject me, let me show you…the voice declared.Let me show both of you…
 Before Rhonin could protest, images filled his head. He relived Krasus’s astonishment at being contacted
by the Lord of Time, experienced the dragon mage’s shock when the Aspect’s desperation became
evident. Everything Krasus had experienced, the wizard and his wife now shared.
 Last of all, Krasus overwhelmed them with an image of the place the other believed the source of
Nozdormu’s distress, a chill and forbidding chain of jagged mountains.
 Kalimdor.
 The entire vision lasted only a few seconds, but it left Rhonin exhausted. He heard a gasp from the bed.
Turning, the wizard found Vereesa slumped back on the down pillow.
 He started toward her, but she waved off his concern. “I am all right! Just…breathless. Give me a
moment…”
 For her Rhonin would give eternity, but for another he had not even a second to grant. Summoning the
image of Krasus into his head, the wizard replied,Take your quests to someone else! Those days are
through for me! I’ve got far more important matters at stake!
 Krasus said nothing and Rhonin wondered if his response had sent his former patron searching for
another pawn. He respected Krasus, even liked him, but the Rhonin the dragon mage sought no longer
existed. Only his family concerned him now.
 But to his surprise, the one he expected most to stand by him instead suddenly muttered, “You will have
to go immediately, of course.”
 He stared at Vereesa. “I’m not going anywhere!”
 She straightened again. “But you must. You saw what I saw. He does not summon you for some
frivolous task! Krasus is extremely worried…and what worrieshim puts fear intome.”
 “But I can’t leave you now!” Rhonin fell down on one knee next to her. “I will not leave you, or them!”
 A hint of her ranger past spread across Vareesa’s face. Eyes narrowing dangerously at whatever
mysterious force would separate them, she answered, “And the last thing I would wish would be for you
to thrust yourself into danger! I do not desire to sacrifice my children’s father, but what we have seen
hints at a terrible threat to the world they will be born in! For that reason alone, it makes sense to go.
Were I not in this condition, I would be right at your side, you know that.”
 “Of course I do.”
 “I tell myself that he is strong, Krasus is. Even stronger as Korialstrasz! I tell myself that I let you go only
because you and he will be together. You know he would not ask if he did not think you capable.”
 That was true. Dragons respected few mortal creatures. That Krasus in either form looked to him for aid
meant a great deal…and as an ally of the leviathan, Rhonin would be better protected than anyone.
 What could go wrong?
 Defeated, Rhonin nodded. “All right. I’ll go. Can you handle matters until Jalia arrives?”
 “With my bow, I have shot orcs dead at a hundred yards. I have battled trolls, demons, and more. I
have nearly traveled the length and breadth of Azeroth…yes, my love, I think I can handle the situation
until Jalia arrives.”
 He leaned down and kissed her. “Then I’d best let Krasus know I’ll be coming. For a dragon, he’s an
impatient sort.”
 “He has taken the burden of the world upon his shoulders, Rhonin.”
 That still did not make the wizard overly sympathetic. An ageless dragon was far more capable of
dealing with terrible crises than a mere mortal spellcaster about to become a father.
 Fixing on an image of the dragon mage as he knew him best, Rhonin reached out to his former patron.All
right, Krasus. I’ll help you. Where should we rendez—
 Darkness enveloped the wizard. Off in the distance, he heard Vereesa’s faint voice call out his name. A
sense of vertigo threatened Rhonin.
 His boots suddenly clattered on hard rock. Every bone in his body shook from the impact and it was all
he could do to keep his legs from collapsing.
 Rhonin stood in a massive cave clearly hollowed out by more than simply the whims of nature. The roof
was almost a perfect oval and the walls had been scorched smooth. A dim illumination with no
discernible source enabled him to see the lone, robed figure awaiting him in the center.
 “So…” Rhonin managed. “I guess we rendezvous here.”
 Krasus stretched one long, gloved hand to the left. “There is a pack containing rations and water for
you, just to your side. Take it and follow me.”
 “I barely had a chance to say good-bye to my wife…” grumbled Rhonin as he retrieved the large leather
pack and looped it over his shoulders.
 “You have my sympathies,” the dragon mage responded, walking ahead already. “I have made
arrangements to see to it that she is not without aid. She will be well while we are gone.”
 Listening to Krasus for just a few seconds reminded Rhonin how often the ancient figure made
assumptions about him without even waiting for the young wizard’s decisions. Krasus had already taken
the matter of Rhonin’s agreement as settled.
 He followed the tall, narrow figure to the mouth of the vast cave. That Krasus had moved his lair since
the war with the orcs Rhonin had known, but exactly where he had moved was another question. Now
the human saw that the cavern overlooked a familiar set of mountains, ones not at all that far off from his
own home. Unlike their counterparts in Kalimdor, these mountains had a majestic beauty to them, not a
sense of dread.
 “We’re almost neighbors,” he remarked dryly.
 “A coincidence, but it made bringing you here possible. Had I sought you from the lair of my queen, the
spellwork would have been much more depleting and I have every wish of retaining as much of my
power as possible.”
 The tone with which he spoke drained Rhonin of all animosity. Never had he heard such concern from
Krasus. “You spoke of Nozdormu, the Aspect of Time. Have you managed to contact him again?”
 “No…and that is why we must take every precaution. In fact, we must not use magic to transport
ourselves to the location. We will have to fly.”
 “But if we don’t use magic, how can we possibly fly—”
 Krasus spread his arms…and as he did, they transformed, becoming scaled and taloned. His body grew
rapidly and wide, leathery wings formed. Krasus’s narrow visage stretched, twisted, becoming reptilian.
 “Of course,” Rhonin muttered. “How silly of me.”
 Korialstrasz the dragon peered down at his tiny companion.
 “Climb atop, Rhonin. We must be off.”
 The wizard reluctantly obeyed, recalling from times past the best manner with which to seat himself. He
slipped his feet under crimson scale, then crouched low behind the dragon’s sinewy neck. His fingers
clutched other scale. Although Rhonin understood that Korialstrasz would do his best to keep his charge
from slipping off, the human did not want to take a chance. One never knew what even a dragon might
encounter in the sky.
 The great, webbed wings flapped once, twice, then suddenly dragon and rider rose high into the
heavens. With each beat, miles fell away. Korialstrasz flew effortlessly along, and Rhonin could feel the
giant’s blood race. Although he spent much of his time in the guise of Krasus, the dragon clearly felt at
home in the air.
 Cold air assailed Rhonin’s head, making the wizard wish he had at least been given the opportunity to
change into his robes and travel cloak. He reached back, trying to draw his coat up—and discovered his
garment now had a hood.
 Glancing down, Rhonin found that he did indeed wear the dark blue travel cloak and robes over his shirt
and pants. Without so much as a word, his companion had transformed his clothing to something more
suitable.
 The hood drawn over his head, Rhonin contemplated what lay ahead. What could distress the Lord of
Time so much? The threat sounded both immediate and catastrophic…and surely much more than a
mortal wizard could handle.
 Yet, Korialstrasz had turned to him…
 Rhonin hoped he would prove worthy, not only for the dragon’s sake…but for the lives of the wizard’s
growing family.

 Impossible as it seemed, somewhere along the way Rhonin fell asleep. Despite that, even then he did not
tumble from his seat to certain death. Korialstrasz certainly had something to do with that, although to all
appearances the dragon appeared to be flying blithely along.
 The sun had nearly set. Rhonin was about to ask his companion if he intended to fly through the night
when Korialstrasz began to descend. Peering down, the wizard at first sighted only water, surely the
Great Sea. He did not recall red dragons being very aquatic. Did Korialstrasz intend to land like a duck
upon the water?
 A moment later, his question was answered as an ominous rock appeared in the distance. No…not a
rock, but an island almost entirely bare of vegetation.
 A feeling of dread swept over Rhonin, one he had felt before while crossing the sea toward the land of
Khaz Modan. Then it had been with dwarven gryphon riders and the island they had flown over was Tol
Barad, an accursed place overrun early on by the orcs. The island’s inhabitants had been slaughtered,
their home ravaged, and the wizard’s highly attuned senses had felt their spirits crying out for vengeance.
 Now he experienced the same kind of horrific, mournful cries again.
 Rhonin shouted to the dragon, but either the wind swept away his voice or Korialstrasz chose not to
hear him. The leathery wings adjusted, slowing their descent to a gentle decline.
 They came to a halt atop a promontory overlooking a series of shadowed, ruined structures. Too small
for a city, Rhonin assumed them to have once been a fort or perhaps even a walled estate. In either case,
the buildings cast an ominous image that only reinforced the wizard’s concerns.
 “How soon will we be moving along?” he asked Korialstrasz, still hoping that the dragon only intended
to rest a moment before moving on to Kalimdor.
 “Not until sunrise. We must pass near the Maelstrom to reach Kalimdor, and we will need our full wits
and strength about us for that. This is the only island I have seen for some time.”
 “What’s it called?”
 “That knowledge is not mine.”
 Korialstrasz settled down, allowing Rhonin to dismount. The wizard stepped just far enough from his
companion to catch one last glimpse of the ruins before darkness enveloped them.
 “Something tragic happened here,” Korialstrasz suddenly commented.
 “You sense it, too?”
 “Yes…but what it was I cannot say. Still, we should be secure up here and I have no intention of
transforming.”
 That comforted Rhonin some, but even still he chose to remain as near to the dragon as possible.
Despite a reputation for recklessness, the wizard was no fool. Nothing would entice him down into those
ruins.
 His gargantuan comrade almost immediately went to sleep, leaving a much more wound-up Rhonin to
stare at the night sky. Vereesa’s image filled his thoughts. The twins were due shortly and he hoped that
he would not miss their coming because of this journey. Birth was a magic unto itself, one that Rhonin
could never master.
 Thinking of his family eased the mage’s tensions and before he knew it, he drifted off to slumber. There,
Vereesa and the as-yet-unborn twins continued to keep him loving company even though the children
were never quite defined as male or female.
 Vereesa faded into the background, leaving Rhonin with the twins. They called to him, beseeched him to
come to them. In his dreams, Rhonin began running over a countryside, the children ever more distant
shapes on the horizon. What started as a game became a hunt. The once-happy calls turned fearful.
Rhonin’s children needed him, but first he had to find them…and quickly.
 “Papa! Papa!” came their voices.
 “Where are you? Where are you?” The wizard pushed through a tangle of branches that only seemed to
tangle more the harder he pushed. At last he broke through, only to find a towering castle.
 And from above, the children called again. He saw their distant shapes reaching out to him. Rhonin cast
a spell to make him rise up in the air, but as he did, the castle grew to match his efforts.
 Frustrated, he willed himself up faster.
 “Papa! Papa!” called the voices, now somewhat distorted by the wind.
 At last he neared the tower window where the two waited. Their arms stretched, trying to cut the
distance between Rhonin and them. His fingers came within a few scant inches of theirs…
 And suddenly a huge form barreled into the castle, shaking it to its very base and sending both Rhonin
and his children tumbling earthward. Rhonin sought desperately to save them, but a monstrous, leathery
hand snatched him up and took him away.
 “Wake up! Wake up!”
 The wizard’s head pounded. Everything around him began swirling. The hand lost its hold and once
more he plummeted.
 “Rhonin! Wherever you are! Awaken!”
 Below him, two shadowy forms hurried to catch him…his children now trying to savehis life. Rhonin
smiled at the pair and they smiled back.
 Smiled back with sharp, vicious teeth.
 And just in time, Rhonindid awaken.
 Instead of falling, he lay on his back. The stars above revealed that surrounding him now was a roofless
ruin of a building. The dank smell of decay assailed his nostrils and a horrific, hissing sound beset his ears.
 He lifted his head—and looked into a face out of nightmare.
 If someone had taken a human skull, dipped it in soft, melting wax and let that wax drip free, that would
have come close to describing the gut-wrenching vision at which Rhonin stared. Add to that
needle-shaped teeth filling the mouth, along with red, soulless orbs that glared hungrily at the wizard, and
the picture of hellish horror was made complete.
 It moved toward him on legs much too long and reached out with bony arms that ended in three long,
curved fingers that gouged into the already ravaged stone. Over its macabre form it wore the ripped
remnants of a once-regal coat and pants. It was so thin that at first Rhonin did not think it had any flesh at
all, but then he saw that an almost transparent layer of skin covered the ribs and other visible areas.
 The wizard scrambled back just as the monstrosity grabbed at his foot. The slime-encrusted mouth
opened, but instead of a hiss or a shriek, there came a childlike voice.
 “Papa!”
 The same voice in Rhonin’s dream.
 He shivered at such a sound coming from the ghoul, but at the same time the cry sent an urge through
him. Again he felt as if his own children called to him, an impossibility.
 An earth-shaking roar suddenly filled the ruined building, eradicating any urge to fling himself into the
deadly talons of the fiend. Rhonin pointed at the creature, muttering.
 A ring of fire burst to life around it. Now the pale monstrosity shrieked. It rose as high as its ungainly
limbs would enable it, trying to climb over the flames.
 “Rhonin!” Korialstrasz shouted from without. “Where are you?”
 “Here! In here! A place no longer with a roof!”
 As the mage replied, the gaunt creature suddenly leapt through the fire.
 Flames licking its body in half a dozen places, it opened its maw far wider than should have been
possible, wide enough to engulf Rhonin’s head.
 Before the wizard could cast another spell, a huge shadow blotted out the stars and a great paw caught
the ghoulish beast square. With another shriek, the still-burning horror flew across the chamber, crashing
into a wall with such force the stones caved in around it.
 A breath of dragon fire finished what Rhonin’s own spell had begun.
 The stench almost overwhelmed the wizard. Holding one sleeve over his nose and mouth, he watched as
Korialstrasz alighted.
 “What—what was that thing?” Rhonin managed to gasp out.
 Even in the dark, he could sense the leviathan’s disgust. “I believe…I believe it was once one of those
who called this home.”
 Rhonin eyed the charred form.“That was once human? How could that be?”
 “You have seen the horrors unleashed by the Undead Scourge during the struggle against the Burning
Legion. You need not ask.”
 “Is this their work?”
 Korialstrasz exhaled. Clearly he had been as disturbed as Rhonin by this encounter. “No…this is much
older…and even more unholy an act than the Lich King ever perpetrated.”
 “Kras—Korialstrasz, it entered my dreams! Manipulated them!”
 “Yes, the others sought to do the same with me—”
 “Others?”Rhonin glanced around, another spell already forming on his lips. He felt certain that the ruins
swarmed with the fiends.
 “We are safe…for the time being. Several are now less than what remains of yours and the rest have
scattered into every crevice and gap in these ruins. I believe there are cata-combs below and that they
slumber there when not hunting victims.”
 “We can’t stay here.”
 “No,” agreed the dragon. “We cannot. We must move on to Kalimdor.”
 He lowered himself so that Rhonin could climb aboard, then immediately flapped his wings. The pair
rose into the dark sky.
 “When we have succeeded with our mission, I will return here and end this abomination,” Korialstrasz
declared. In a softer tone, he added, “There are already too many abominations in this world.”
 Rhonin did not answer him, instead taking one last glance down. It might have been a trick of his eyes,
but he thought that he saw more of the ghouls emerging now that the dragon had left. In fact, it seemed to
him that they gathered by the dozens, all of them looking up hungrily…at the wizard.
 He tore his gaze away, actually happy to be on the journey to Kalimdor. Surely after a night such as this,
whatever awaited the pair could hardly be worse.
 Surely…
 THREE
 Korialstrasz reached the shores of Kalimdor late in the day. He and Rhonin paused only to eat—the
dragon imbibing in fare away from the wizard’s sight—and then set off again for the vast mountain chain
that covered much of the western regions of the land. Korialstrasz flew with more and more urgency as
they neared their goal. He had not told Rhonin that every now and then he attempted to contact
Nozdormu…attempted and failed. Soon, however, that would not matter, for they would know firsthand
what had so distressed the Aspect of Time.
 “That peak!” Rhonin shouted. Although he had slept again, he hardly felt fresh. Nightmares concerning
the sinister island had haunted his dreams. “I recognize that peak!”
 The dragon nodded. It was the final landmark before their destination. Had he not seen it at the same
time as his rider, he would have nonetheless sensed the wrongness in the very fabric of reality…and that
meant something terrible indeed awaited them.
 Despite that certainty, the leviathan only picked up his pace. There was no other choice. Whatever lay
ahead, the only ones who might stop it were him and the tiny human figure he carried.
 * * *
 But while the sharp eyes of man and dragon had sighted their destination, they failed to notice eyes that
had sighted them in turn.
 “A red dragon…” grumbled the first orc. “A red dragon with a rider…”
 “One of us, Brox?” asked the second. “Another orc?”
 Brox snorted at his companion. The other orc was young, too young to have been much use in the war
against the Legion, and he certainly would not have remembered when it had been orcs, not humans,
who had ridden such beasts. Gaskal only knew the stories, the legends. “Gaskal, you fool, the only way a
dragon’d carry an orc these days would be in his belly!”
 Gaskal shrugged, unconcerned. He looked every inch the proud orc warrior—tall and muscular with a
rough, greenish hide and two good-sized tusks thrusting upward from his broad, lower jaw. He had the
squat nose and thick, bushy brow of an orc and a mane of dark hair trailing down between his shoulders.
In one meaty hand Gaskal hefted a huge war ax while with the other he clutched the strap of his goatskin
backpack. Like Brox, he was clad in a thick, fur cloak under which he wore a leather kilt and sandals
wrapped in cloth to preserve heat. A hardy race, orcs could survive any element, but high in the
mountains even they required more warmth.
 Brox, too, was a proud warrior, but time had beaten at him as no other enemy could. He stood several
inches shorter than Gaskal, part of that due to a slight but permanent stoop. The veteran warrior’s mane
had thinned and started going gray. Scars and lines of age had ravaged his wide, bullish visage, and unlike
his youthful companion, the constant expression of eagerness had given way to thoughtful distrust and
weariness.
 Hefting his well-worn war hammer, Brox trudged through the deep snow. “They’re heading for the same
place as us.”
 “How’d you know that?”
 “Where else would they be going here?”
 Finding no argument, Gaskal quieted, giving Brox the chance to think about the reason that had sent
both of them to this desolate place.
 He had not been there when the old shaman had come to Thrall seeking an immediate audience, but he
had heard the details. Naturally, Thrall had acquiesced, for he very much followed the old ways and
considered Kalthar a sage advisor. If Kalthar needed to see him immediately, it could only be for a very
good reason.
 Or a very bad one.
 * * *
 With the aid of two of Thrall’s guards, withered Kalthar entered and took a seat before the towering
Warchief. Out of respect for the elder, Thrall sat on the floor, enabling the eyes of both to meet at the
same level. Across Thrall’s folded legs lay the massive, square-headed Doomhammer, bane of the
Horde’s enemies for generations.
 The new Warchief of the orcs was broad-shouldered, muscular, and, for his position, relatively young.
No one doubted Thrall’s ability to rule, however. He had taken the orcs from the internment camps and
given them back their honor and pride. He had made the pact with the humans which brought about the
chance for the Horde to begin life anew. The people already sang songs of him that would be passed
down generation after generation.
 Clad in thick, ebony plate armor etched in bronze—handed down to him along with the huge weapon by
his predecessor, the legendary Orgrim Doomhammer—the greatest of warriors bent his head low and
humbly asked, “How may I assist you who honor my presence, great one?”
 “Only by listening,” Kalthar returned. “And bytruly listening.”
 The strong-jawed Warchief leaned forward, his startling and so very rare blue eyes—considered a
portent of destiny by his people——narrowed in anticipation. In his journey from slave and gladiator to
ruler, Thrall had studied the path of the shaman, even mastering some of the skills. He more than most
understood that when Kalthar talked so, he did with good reason.
 And so the shaman told Thrall of the vision of the funnel and how time seemed a plaything to it. He told
him of the voices and their warnings, told him about the wrongness he had felt.
 Told Thrall what he feared would happen if the situation was left unchecked.
 When Kalthar finished, the Warchief leaned back. Around his throat he wore a single medallion upon
which had been inscribed in gold an ax and hammer. His eyes revealed the quick wit and intelligence that
marked him as a capable leader. When he moved, he moved not as a brutish orc might, but with a grace
and poise more akin to a human or an elf.
 “This smells of magic,” he rumbled. “Big magic. Something for wizards…maybe.”
 “They may know already,” returned Kalthar. “But we cannot afford to wait for them, great Warchief.”
 Thrall understood. “You would have me send someone to this place you saw?”
 “It would seem most prudent. At least so we may know what we face.”
 The Warchief rubbed his chin. “I think I know who. A good warrior.” He looked to the guards. “Brox!
Get me Brox!”

 And so Brox had been summoned and told his mission. Thrall respected Brox highly, for the older
warrior had been a hero of the last war, the only survivor of a band of brave fighters holding a critical
pass against the demons. With his war hammer Brox himself had caved in the skulls of more than a dozen
of the fiery foes. His last comrade had died cleaved in two just as reinforcements had arrived to save the
day. Scarred, covered in blood, and standing alone amid the carnage, Brox had appeared to the
newcomers as a vision out of the old tales of his race. His name became almost as honored as that of
Thrall.
 But it was more than the veteran’s name that garnered the respect of the Warchief and made him
Thrall’s choice. Thrall knew that Brox was like him, a warrior who fought with his head as well as his
arm. The orc leader could not send an army into the mountains. He needed to trust the search to one or
two skilled fighters who could then report their findings to him.
 Gaskal was chosen to accompany Brox because of his swiftness and absolute obedience to orders. The
younger orc was part of the new generation that would grow up in relative peace with the other races.
Brox was glad to have the able fighter at his side.
 The shaman had so perfectly described the route through the mountains that the pair were well ahead of
the estimated time the trek should have taken. By Brox’s reckoning, their goal lay just beyond the next
ridge…exactly where the dragon and rider had vanished.
 Brox’s grip on his hammer tightened. The orcs had agreed to peace, but he and Gaskal would fight if
need be, even if it meant their certain deaths.
 The older warrior forced away the grim smile that nearly played across his face at the last thought. Yes,
he would be willing to fight to the death. What Thrall had not known when he summoned the war hero to
him had been that Brox suffered from terrible guilt, guilt that had eaten at his soul since that day in the
pass.
 They had all perished, all but Brox, and he could not understand that. He felt guilty for being alive, for
not dying valiantly with his comrades. To him, his still being alive was a matter of shame, of failure to give
his all as they had done. Since that time, he had waited and hoped for some opportunity to redeem
himself. Redeem himself…and die.
 Now, perhaps, the fates had granted him that.
 “Get a move on!” he ordered Gaskal. “We can reach ’em before they get settled in!” Now he allowed
himself a wide grin, one that his companion would read as typical orc enthusiasm. “And if they give us
any trouble…we’ll make ’em think the entire Horde is on the rampage again!”

 If the island upon which they had landed seemed a dire place, the mountain pass in which they now
descended simply feltwrong. That was the best word Rhonin could use to describe the sensations flowing
through him. Whatever they sought…it should not be. It was as if the very fabric of reality had made
some terrible error…
 The intensity of the feeling was such that the wizard, who had faced every conceivable nightmare,
wanted the dragon to turn back. He said nothing, though, recalling how he had already revealed his
uncertainties on the island. Korialstrasz might already regret summoning him.
 The crimson behemoth arched his wings as he dropped the final distance. His massive paws sank into
the snow as he sought a stable landing area.
 Rhonin clutched the dragon’s neck tightly. He felt every vibration and hoped his grip would last. His
pack bounced against his back, pummeling him.
 At last, Korialstrasz came to a halt. The reptilian visage turned the wizard’s way. “Are you well?”
 “As well—as well as I could be!” gasped Rhonin. He had made dragon flights before, but not for so
long.
 Either Korialstrasz knew his passenger was still weary or the dragon himself also needed rest after such
a monumental trek. “We shall remain here for a few hours. Gather our strength. I sense no change in the
emanations I feel. We should have the time to recoup. It would be the wisest choice.”
 “I won’t be arguing with you,” Rhonin answered, sliding off.
 The wind blew harshly through the mountains and the high peaks left much shadow, but with the aid of
some magic and an overhang, the wizard managed to keep warm enough. While he tried to stretch the
kinks out of his body, Korialstrasz strode along the pass, scouting the area. The behemoth vanished
some distance ahead as the path curved.
 Hood draping his head, Rhonin dozed. This time, his thoughts filled with good images…true images of
Vereesa and the upcoming birth. The wizard smiled, thinking of his return.
 He woke at the sound of approach. To Rhonin’s surprise, it was not the dragon Korialstrasz who
returned to him, but rather the cowled, robed figure of Krasus.
 In response to the human’s widening eyes, the dragon mage explained, “There are several unstable areas
nearby. This form is less likely to cause them to collapse. I can always transform again should the need
arise.”
 “Did you find anything?”
 The not-quite-elven face pursed. “I sense the Aspect of Time. He is here and yet he is not. I am
disturbed by that.”
 “Should we start—”
 But before Rhonin could finish, a horrific yowl echoed harshly through the mountain chain. The sound set
every nerve of the wizard on edge. Even Krasus looked perturbed.
 “What was that?” asked Rhonin.
 “I do not know.” The dragon mage drew himself up. “We should move on. Our goal lies not far away.”
 “We’re not flying?”
 “I sense that what we seek lies within a narrow passage between the next mountains. A dragon would
not fit, but two small travelers would.”
 With Krasus leading, the pair headed northeast. Rhonin’s companion appeared unbothered by the cold,
though the human had to enhance the protective spell on his clothes. Even then, he felt the chill of the land
upon his face and fingers.
 Before long, they came upon the beginning of the passage Krasus had mentioned. Rhonin saw now what
the other meant. The passage was little more than a cramped corridor. Half a dozen men could walk
side-by-side through it without feeling constricted, but a dragon attempting to enter would have barely
been able to get its head in, much less its gargantuan body. The high, steep sides also created even
thicker shadows, making Rhonin wonder if the two might need to create some sort of illumination along
the way.
 Krasus pressed on without hesitation, certain of their path. He moved faster and faster, almost as if
possessed.
 The wind howled even harder through the natural corridor, its intensity building as they journeyed. Only
human, Rhonin had to struggle to keep pace with his former patron.
 “Are we almost there?” he finally called.
 “Soon. It lies only—” Krasus paused.
 “What is it?”
 The dragon mage focused inwardly, frowning. “It is not—it is not exactly where it should be anymore.”
 “Itmoved?”
 “That would be my assumption.”
 “Is it supposed to do that?” the fiery-haired wizard asked, squinting down the dark path ahead.
 “You are under the misconception that I know perfectly what to expect, Rhonin. I understand little more
than you.”
 That did not at all please the human. “So what do you suggest we do?”
 The eyes of the inhuman mage literally flared as he contemplated the question. “We go on. That is all we
can do.”
 But only a short distance ahead, they came across a new obstacle of sorts, one that Krasus had been
unable to foresee from high up in the air. The passage split off in two directions and while it was possible
that they merged further on, the pair could not assume that.
 Krasus eyed both paths. “They each run near to our goal, but I cannot sense which lies closer. We need
to investigate both.”
 “Do we separate?”
 “I would prefer not to, but we must. We will each journey five hundred paces in, then turn back and
meet here. Hopefully we will then have a better sense of which to take.”
 Taking the corridor to the left, Rhonin followed Krasus’s instructions. As he rapidly counted off paces,
he soon determined that his choice had potential. Not only did it greatly widen ahead, but the wizard
thought he sensed the disturbance better than ever. While Krasus’s abilities were more acute than his,
even a novice could sense the wrongness that now pervaded the region beyond.
 But despite his confidence in his choice, Rhonin did not yet turn around. Curiosity drove him on. Surely a
few steps more would hardly matter—
 He had barely taken more than one, however, when he sensed something new, something quite
disturbing. Rhonin paused, trying to detect what felt different about the anomaly.
 It was moving, but there was more to his anxiety than that alone.
 It was moving towardhim …and rapidly.
 He felt it before he saw it, felt as if all time compressed, then stretched, then compressed again. Rhonin
felt old, young, and every moment of life in between. Overwhelmed, the wizard hesitated.
 And the darkness before him gave way to a myriad flaring of colors, some of which he had never seen
before. A continual explosion of elemental energy filled both empty air and solid rock, rising to fantastic
heights. Rhonin’s limited mind saw it best as a looming, fiery flower that bloomed, burnt away, and
bloomed again…and with each blooming grew more and more imposing.
 As it neared, he finally came to his senses. Whirling, the mage ran.
 Sounds assailed his ears. Voices, music, thunder, birds, water…everything.
 Despite his fears that it would overtake him, the phenomenal display fell behind. Rhonin did not stop
running, fearing that at any moment it would surge forward and envelop him.
 Krasus surely had to have sensed the latest shift. He had to be hurrying to meet Rhonin. Together, they
would devise some way in which to—
 A terrible howl echoed through the pass.
 A massive, eight-legged lupine form dropped down on him.
 Had he been other than what he was, the wizard would have perished there, the meal of a savage,
saber-toothed creature with four gleaming green eyes to go with its eight clawed limbs. The monstrous
wolf-creature brought him down, but Rhonin, having magicked his garments to better protect him from
the elements, proved a hard nut to crack. The claws scraped at a cloak it should have readily tattered,
only to have instead one nail snap off.
 Gray fur standing on end, the beast howled its frustration. Rhonin took the opening, casting a simple but
effective spell that had saved him in the past.
 A cacophony of light burst before the creature’s emerald orbs, both blinding and startling it. It ducked
back, swatting uselessly at flashing patterns.
 Dragging himself out of reach, Rhonin rose. There was no chance of flight; that would only serve to turn
his back on the beast and his protective spell was already weakening. A few more slashes and the claws
would be ripping the wizard to the bone.
 Fire had worked against the ghoul on the island and Rhonin saw no reason why such a tried and true
spell would not benefit him again. He muttered the words—
 …Which, inexplicably, came out in reverse. Worse, Rhonin found himself moving backward, returning
to the wild claws of the blinded beast.
 Timehad turned in on itself…but how?
 The answer materialized from further in the passage. Krasus’s anomaly had caught up.
 Ghostly images fluttered by Rhonin. Knights riding into battle. A wedding scene. A storm over the sea.
Orcs uttering war chants around a fire. Strange creatures locked in combat…
 Suddenly he could move forward again. Rhonin darted out of the beast’s reach, then turned to face it
again. This time, he did not hesitate, casting his spell.
 The flames burst forth in the form of a great hand, but as they neared the monstrous creature, they
slowed…then stopped, frozen in time.
 Swearing, Rhonin started another spell.
 The eight-legged horror leapt around the frozen fire, howling as it charged the human.
 Rhonin cast.
 The earth beneath the abomination exploded, a storm of dirt rising up and covering the lupine creature. It
howled again and, despite the intense forces against it, struggled toward the mage.
 A crust formed over the legs and torso. The mouth shut tight as a layer of rock-solid earth sealed it. One
by one, the inhuman orbs were covered by a film of dust.
 Just a few feet from its victim, the creature stilled. To all appearances, it now seemed but a perfectly cast
statue, not the actual monster itself.
 At that moment, Krasus’s voice filled Rhonin’s head.
 At last!the dragon mage called.Rhonin…the disturbance is expanding! It’s almost upon you!
 Distracted by the fearsome beast, the wizard had not glanced at the anomaly. When he did, his eyes
widened.
 It filled a space ten times higher and, no doubt, ten times wider than the pass. Solid rock meant nothing
to it. The anomaly simply passed through it as if it did not exist. Yet, in its wake, the landscape changed.
Some of the rock looked more weathered, while other portions appeared as if newly cooled from the
titanic throes of birth. The worst transformations seemed to take place wherever the edges of the fiery
flower touched.
 Rhonin did not want to think what would happen to him if the thing touched him.
 He started running again.
 Its movement and growth have suddenly expanded much faster for reasons I do not understand,Krasus
went on.I fear I will not reach you in time! You must cast a spell of teleportation!
 My spellwork doesn’t always work the way it should!he responded.The anomaly’s affecting it!
 We will stay linked! That should help strengthen your casting! I will guide you to me and we can
regroup!
 Rhonin did not care to teleport himself to places he had never seen, the inherent risk being that of ending
up encased in a mountain, but with Krasus linked to him, the task would be a much simpler one.
 He focused on Krasus, picturing the dragon mage. The spell began to form. Rhonin felt the world around
him shift.
 The fiery blossom suddenly expanded to nearly twice its previous dimensions.
 Only too late did Rhonin realize why. It was reacting to the use of magic…his magic. He wanted to stop
the spell, but it was already too late.
 Krasus! Break the link! Break it before you’re also—
 The anomaly swallowed him.
 Rhonin?
 But Rhonin could not answer. He flailed around and around, tossed about like a leaf in a tornado. With
each revolution he flew faster and faster. The sounds and sights again assailed him. He saw past, present,
and future and understood each for what it was. He caught a glimpse of the petrified beast as it flew
wildly past him into what could only be described as a whirlpool in time.
 Other things flew by, random objects and even creatures. An entire ship, its sails tattered, its hull crushed
in near the bow, soared by, vanishing. A tree on which still perched a flock of birds followed. In the
distance, a kraken, fifty feet in length from tip of head to end of tentacle, reached out but failed to drag
Rhonin along before vanishing with the rest.
 From somewhere came Krasus’s faint voice.Rhonin…
 He answered, but there was no reply.
 The whirlpool filled his gaze.
 And as it sucked him in, Rhonin’s last thoughts were of Vereesa and the children he would never know.
 FOUR
 He sensed the slow but steady growth of the leaves, the branches, and the roots. He sensed the timeless
wisdom, the eternal thoughts within. Each giant had its own unique signature, as was true with any
individual.
 They are the guardians of the forest,came his mentor’s voice.They are as much its soul as I. They arethe
forest. A pause.Now…come back to us…
 Malfurion Stormrage’s mind respectfully withdrew from the gargantuan trees, the eldest of the heavily
wooded land. As he retreated, his own physical surroundings gradually reappeared, albeit murky at first.
He blinked his silver, pupilless eyes twice, bringing everything back into focus. His breath came in ragged
gasps, but his heart swelled with pride. Never before had he reached so far!
 “You have learned well, young night elf,” a voice like a bear’s rumbled. “Better than even I could have
expected…”
 Sweat poured down Malfurion’s violet countenance. His patron had insisted that he attempt this next
monumental step at the height of day, his people’s weakest point of time. Had it been at night, Malfurion
felt certain that he would have been stronger, but as Cenarius pointed out again and again, that would
have defeated the purpose. What his mentor taught him was not the sorcery of the night elves, but almost
its exact opposite.
 And in so many ways, Malfurion had already become the opposite of his people. Despite their
tendencies toward flamboyant garments, for instance, Malfurion’s own were very subdued. A cloth tunic,
a simple leather jerkin and pants, knee-high boots…his parents, had they not perished by accident years
before, would have surely died of shame.
 His shoulder-length, dark green hair surrounded a narrow visage akin to a wolf’s. Malfurion had become
something of an outcast among his kind. He asked questions, suggested that old traditions were not
necessarily the best, and even dared once mention that beloved Queen Azshara might not always have
the concerns of her subjects foremost on her thoughts. Such actions left him with few associates and even
fewer friends.
 In fact, in Malfurion’s mind, he could truly only count three as friends. First and foremost had to be his
own twin, the equally troublesome Illidan. While Illidan did not shy away from the traditions and sorcery
of the night elves as much as he, he had a tendency to question the governing authority of the elders, also
a great crime.
 “What did you see?” his brother, seated beside him on the grass, asked eagerly. Illidan would have been
identical to Malfurion if not for his midnight blue hair and amber eyes. Children of the moon, nearly all
night elves had eyes of silver. Those very few born with ones of amber were seen as destined for
greatness.
 But if greatness was to be Illidan’s, he first had to curb both his temper and his impatience. He had come
with his twin to study this new path that used the power of nature—their mentor termed it
“druidism”—believing he would be the quicker student. Instead, he often miscast spells and failed to
concentrate enough to maintain most trances. That he was fairly adept at traditional sorcery did not
assuage Illidan. He had wanted to learn the ways of druidism because such unique skills would mark him
as different, as nearing that potential everyone had spoken about since his birth.
 “I saw…” How to explain it even to his brother? Malfurion’s brow wrinkled. “I saw into the hearts of
the trees, the souls. Not simply theirs, either. I saw…I think I saw into the souls of the entire forest!”
 “How wonderful!” gasped a female voice at his other side.
 Malfurion fought to keep his cheeks from darkening to black, the night elf equivalent of embarrassment.
Of late, he had been finding himself more and more uncomfortable around his other companion…and yet
he could not think of himself far from her, either.
 With the brothers had come Tyrande Whisperwind, their greatest friend since childhood. They had
grown up together, the three, inseparable in every way until the last year, when she had taken the robes
of a novice priestess in the temple of Elune, the moon goddess. There she learned to become attuned to
the spirit of the goddess, learned to use the gifts all priestesses were granted in order to let them spread
the word of their mistress. She it had been who had encouraged Malfurion when he had chosen to turn
from the sorcery of the night elves to another, earthier power. Tyrande saw druidism as a kindred force
to the abilities her deity would grant her once she completed her own training.
 But from a thin pale child who had more than once bested both brothers in races and hunting, Tyrande
had become, since joining the temple, a slim yet well-curved beauty, her smooth skin now a soft, light
violet and her dusky blue hair streaked with silver. The mousy face had grown fuller, much more feminine
and appealing.
 Perhaps too appealing.
 “Hmmph!” added Illidan, not so impressed. “Was thatall?”
 “It is a good start,” rumbled their tutor. The great shadow fell over all three young night elves, stifling
even Illidan’s rampant mouth.
 Although over seven feet tall themselves, the trio were dwarfed by Cenarius, who stood well above ten.
His upper torso was akin to that of Malfurion’s race, although a hint of the emerald forest colored his
dark skin and he had a much broader, more muscular build than either of his male students. Beyond the
upper body any similarity ended. Cenarius was no simple night elf, after all. He was not even mortal.
 Cenarius was a demigod.
 His origins were known only to him, but he was as much a part of the great forest as it was of him.
When the first night elves had appeared, Cenarius had already long existed. He claimed kinship with
them, but never had he said in what way.
 Those few who came to him for guidance left ever touched, ever changed. Others did not even leave,
becoming so transformed by their teachings that they chose instead to join the demigod in the protection
of his realm. Those were no longer elves, but woodland guardians physically altered forever.
 A thick, moss-green mane flowing from his head, Cenarius eyed his pupils fondly with orbs of pure gold.
He patted Malfurion gently on the shoulder with hands that ended in talons of gnarled, aged
wood—talons still capable of ripping the night elf to shreds without effort—then backed away…on four
strong legs.
 The upper torso of the demigod might have resembled that of a night elf, but the lower portion was that
of a huge, magnificent stag. Cenarius moved about effortlessly, as swift and nimble as any of the three.
He had the speed of the wind, the strength of the trees. In him was reflected the life and health of the
land. He was its child and father all in one.
 And like a stag, he also had antlers—giant, glorious antlers that shaded his stern yet fatherly visage.
Matched in prominence only by his lengthy, rich beard, the antlers were the final reminder that any blood
link between demigod and night elf existed far, far in the past.
 “You have all done well,” he added in the voice that ever sounded of thunder. Leaves and twigs literally
growing in his beard, his hair shook whenever the deity spoke. “Go now. Be among your own again for a
time. It will do you some good.”
 All three rose, but Malfurion hesitated. Looking at his companions, he said, “You go on ahead. I’ll meet
you at the trail’s end. I need to talk with Cenarius.”
 “We could wait,” Tyrande replied.
 “There’s no need. I won’t be long.”
 “Then, by all means,” Illidan quickly interjected, taking Tyrande’s arm. “We should let him be. Come,
Tyrande.”
 She gave Malfurion one last lingering glance that made him turn away to conceal his emotions. He waited
for the two to depart, then turned again to the demigod.
 The descending sun created shadows in the forest that seemed to dance for the pleasure of Cenarius.
The demigod smiled at the dancing shadows, the trees and other plants moving in time with them.
 Malfurion went down on one knee, his gaze to the earth. “My shan’do,” he began, calling Cenarius by
the title that meant in the old tongue “honored teacher.” “Forgive me for asking—”
 “You should not act so before me, young one. Arise…”
 The night elf reluctantly obeyed, but he kept his gaze down.
 This made the demigod chuckle, a sound accented by the sudden lively chirping of songbirds. Whenever
Cenarius reacted, the world reacted in concert with him.
 “You pay me even more homage than those who claim to preach in my name. Your brother does not
bend to me and for all her respect of my power, Tyrande Whisperwind gives herself only to Elune.”
 “You offered to teach me—us—” Malfurion responded,
 “what no night elf has ever learned…” He still recalled the day when he had approached the sacred
wood. Legends abounded about Cenarius, but Malfurion had wanted to know the truth. However, when
he had called out to the demigod, he had not actually expected an answer.
 He had also not expected Cenarius to offer to be his teacher. Why the demigod would take on so—
mundane—a task was beyond Malfurion. Yet, here they were together. They were more than deity and
night elf, more than teacher and student…they were also friends.
 “No other night elf truly wishes to learn my ways,” Cenarius replied. “Even those who has taken up the
mantle of the forest…none of them has truly followed the path I now show you. You are the first with the
possible aptitude, the possible will, to trulyunderstand how to wield the forces inherent in all nature. And
when I say ‘you,’ young elf, I speak entirely in the singular.”
 This was not what Malfurion had remained to talk about and so the words struck him hard. “But—but
Tyrande and Illidan—”
 The demigod shook his head. “Of Tyrande, we have already spoken. She has promised herself to Elune
and I will not poach in the Moon Goddess’s realm! Of your brother, however, I can only say that there is
much promise to Illidan…but I believe that promise lies elsewhere.”
 “I—I don’t know what to say…” And in truth, Malfurion did not. To be told so suddenly that Illidan and
he would not follow the same path, that Illidan even appeared to waste his efforts here…it was the first
time that the twins would not share in their success. “No! Illidan will learn! He’s just more headstrong!
There’s so much pressure upon him! His eyes—”
 “Are a sign of some future mark upon the world, but he will not make it following my teachings.”
Cenarius gave Malfurion a gentle smile. “But you will try to teach him yourself, will you not? Perhaps you
can succeed where I have failed?”
 The night elf flushed. Of course his shan’do would read his thoughts on that subject. Yes, Malfurion
intended to do what he could to push Illidan further along…but he knew that doing so would be a harder
task. Learning from the demigod was one thing; learning from Malfurion would be another. It would
show that Illidan was not first, but second.
 “Now,” added the forest lord quietly, as a small red bird alighted on his antlers and its paler mate did so
on his arm. Such sights were common around Cenarius, but they ever left the elf marveling. “You came to
ask of me something…”
 “Yes. Great Cenarius…I’ve been troubled by a dream, a reoccurring one.”
 The golden eyes narrowed. “Only a dream? That is what troubles you?”
 Malfurion grimaced. He had already berated himself several times for even thinking of distracting the
demigod with his problem. Of what harm was a dream, even one that repeated itself? Everyone
dreamed. “Yes…it comes to me every time I sleep and since I’ve been learning from you…it’s grown
stronger, more demanding.”
 He expected Cenarius to laugh at him, but instead the forest lord studied him closely. Malfurion felt the
golden orbs—so much more arresting than even his brother’s own—burrow deep within him, reading the
night elf inside and out.
 At last, Cenarius leaned back. He nodded once to himself and in a more solemn voice said, “Yes, you
are ready, I think.”
 “Ready for what?”
 In response, Cenarius held up one hand. The red bird leapt down to the offered hand, its mate joining it
there. The demigod stroked the backs of both once, whispered something to them, then let the pair fly
off.
 Cenarius looked down at the night elf. “Illidan and Tyrande will be informed that you are staying behind
for a time. They have been told to leave without you.”
 “But why?”
 The golden eyes flared. “Tell me of your dream.”
 Taking a deep breath, Malfurion began. The dream started as always, with the Well of Eternity as its
focal point. At first the waters were calm, but then, from the center, a maelstrom rapidly formed…and
from the depths of the maelstrom, creatures burst forth, some of them harmless, others malevolent. Many
he did not even recognize, as if they came from other worlds, other times. They spread in every direction,
fleeing beyond his sight.
 Suddenly, the whirlpool vanished and Malfurion stood in the midst of Kalimdor…but a Kalimdor
stripped of all life. A horrible evil had laid waste to the entire land, leaving not so much as a blade of
grass or a tiny insect alive. The once-proud cities, the vast, lush woodlands…nothing had been spared.
 Even more terrible, for as far as the eye could see, the scorched, cracked bones of night elves lay strewn
everywhere. The skulls had been caved in. The stench of death was strong in the air. No one, not even
the old, infirm, or young, had been spared.
 Heat, horrific heat, had assailed Malfurion then. Turning, he had seen in the distance a vast fire, an
inferno reaching into the heavens. It burned everything it touched, even the very wind. Where it moved,
nothing…absolutely nothing…remained. Yet, as frightening as the scene had been, it was not that which
had finally awakened the night elf in a cold sweat, but rather something he had sensedabout the fire.
 It had beenalive. It knew the terrors it wrought, knew andreveled in them. Reveled…and hungered for
more.
 All humor had fled Cenarius’s visage by the time Malfurion finished. His gaze flickered to his beloved
forest and the creatures thriving within. “And this nightmare repeats itself with every slumber?”
 “Every one. Without fail.”
 “I fear, then, that this is an omen. I sensed in you from our first encounter the makings of the gift of
prescience—one of the reasons I chose to make myself known to you—but it is stronger than even I
ever expected.”
 “But what does it mean?” the young night elf pleaded. “If you say this is an omen, I’ve got to know what
it portends.”
 “And we shall try to discover that. I said, after all, that you are ready.”
 “Ready for what?”
 Cenarius folded his arms. His tone grew more grave.
 “Ready to walk theEmerald Dream.”
 Nothing in the demigod’s teachings so far had referred to this Emerald Dream, but the manner in which
Cenarius spoke of it made Malfurion realize the importance of this next step. “What is it?”
 “What is it not? The Emerald Dream is the world beyond the waking world. It is the world of the spirit,
the world of the sleepers. It is the world as it might have been, if we sentient creatures had not come
about to ruin it. In the Emerald Dream, it is possible, with practice, to see anything, go anywhere. Your
body will enter a trance and your dream form will fly from it to wherever you need to go.”
 “It sounds—”
 “Dangerous? It is, young Malfurion. Even the well-trained, the experienced, can lose themselves in the
Emerald Dream. You note I call it theEmerald Dream. That is the color of its mistress, Ysera, the Great
Aspect. It is the realm of her and her dragon flight. She guards it well and allows only a few to enter it.
My own dryads and keepers make use of the Emerald Dream in their duties, but sparingly.”
 “I’ve never heard of it,” Malfurion admitted with a shake of his head.
 “Likely because no night elf save those in my service has ever walked it…and they only when they were
no longer of your race. You would be the first of your kind to truly take the path…if you so desire.”
 The idea both unnerved and excited Malfurion. It would be the next step in his studies and a way,
perhaps, to make sense of his constant nightmare. Yet…Cenarius had made it clear that the Emerald
Dream could also be deadly.
 “What—what might happen? What might go wrong?”
 “Even the experienced can lose their way back if they become distracted,” the demigod replied. “Even I.
You must remain focused at all times, know your goal. Otherwise…otherwise your body might sleep
forever.”
 There was more, the night elf suspected, but Cenarius for some reason wanted him to learn on his
own—if Malfurion chose to walk the Emerald Dream.
 He decided he had no other recourse. “How do I start?”
 Cenarius fondly touched the top of his student’s head. “You are certain?”
 “Very.”
 “Then simply sit as you have for your other lessons.” When the slighter figure had obeyed, Cenarius
lowered his own four-legged form to the earth. “I will guide you in this first time, then it is up to you.
Lock your gaze in mine, night elf.”
 The demigod’s golden orbs snared Malfurion’s eyes. Even had he wanted to, it would have taken
mammoth effort for him to pull his own gaze away. He felt himself drawn into Cenarius’s mind, drawn
into a world where all was possible.
 A sense of lightness touched Malfurion.
 Do you feel the songs of the stones, the dance of the wind, the laughter of the rushing water?
 At first, Malfurion felt no such thing, but then he heard the slow, steady grinding, the shifting of earth.
Belatedly, he realized that this was how the stones and rock spoke as, over the eons, they made their
way from one point in the world to another.
 After that, the others became more evident. Every part of nature had its own unique voice. The wind
spun around in merry steps when pleased, or in violent bursts when the mood grew darker. The trees
shook their crowns and the raging water of a nearby river chuckled as the fish within it darted up to
spawn.
 But in the background…Malfurion thought he sensed distant discord. He tried to focus on it, but failed.
 You are not yet in the Emerald Dream. First, you must remove your earthly shell…the voice in his head
instructed.As you reach the state of sleep, you will slip your body off as you would a coat. Start from
your heart and mind, for they are the links that most bind you to the mortal plane. See? This is how it is
done…
 Malfurion touched at his heart with his thoughts, opening it like a door and willing his spirit free. He did
the same with his mind, although the earthly, practical side of any living creature protested at this action.
 Give way to your subconscious. Let it guide you. It knows of the realm of dreaming and is always happy
to return there.
 As Malfurion obeyed, the last barriers slipped away. He felt as if he had sloughed off his skin the way a
snake might. A sense of exhilaration filled him and he almost forgot for what purpose he was doing this.
 But Cenarius had warned him to remain focused and so the night elf fought the euphoria down.
 Now…rise up.
 Malfurion pushed himself up…but his body, legs still folded, remained where it was. His dream form
floated a few feet off the ground, free of all restraints. Had he so desired, Malfurion knew that he could
have flown to the stars themselves.
 But the Emerald Dream lay in a different direction.Turn again to your subconscious, the demigod
instructed.It will show you the path, for that lies within, not without.
 And as he followed Cenarius’s instructions, the night elf saw the world change further around him. A
hazy quality enveloped everything. Images, endless images, overlapped one another, but with
concentration Malfurion discovered that he could see each separately. He heard whispers and realized
that they were the inner voices of dreamers throughout the world.
 From here, you must take the path by yourself.
 He felt his link to Cenarius all but fade. For the sake of Malfurion’s concentration, the demigod had been
forced to pull back. However, Cenarius remained a presence, ready to aid his student if the need arose.
 As Malfurion moved forward, his world turned a brilliant, gemlike green. The haze increased and the
whispers became more audible. A landscape vaguely seen beckoned to him.
 He had become part of the Emerald Dream.
 Following his instincts, Malfurion floated toward the shifting dreamscape. As Cenarius said, it looked as
the world would have looked had night elves and other creatures not come into being. There was a
tranquillity to the Emerald Dream that made it tempting just to stay forever, but Malfurion refused to give
in to that temptation. He had to know the truth about his dreams.
 He had no idea at first where his subconscious was taking him, but somehow suspected it would lead
him to the answers he desired. Malfurion flew over the empty paradise, marveling at all he saw.
 But then, in the midst of his miraculous journey, he felt something amiss again. The faint discord he had
sensed earlier increased. Malfurion tried to ignore it, but it gnawed at him like a starving rat. He finally
veered his spirit form toward it.
 Suddenly, ahead of him lay a huge, black lake. Malfurion frowned, certain that he recognized the
foreboding body of water. Dark waves lapped its shores and an aura of power radiated from its center.
 The Well of Eternity.
 But if this was the Well, where was the city? Malfurion eyed the dreamscape where he knew the capital
should have been, trying to summon an image of it. He had come here for a reason and now he believed
that it had to do with the city. By itself, the Well of Eternity was an astonishing thing, but it was the source
of power only. The discord the night elf felt originated from somewhere else.
 He stared at the empty world, demanding to see the reality.
 And without warning, Malfurion’s dream self materialized over Zin-Azshari, the capital of the night elves.
In the old tongue, Zin-Azshari translated into “The Glory of Azshara.” So beloved had the queen been
when she had made her ascension to the throne that the people had insisted on renaming the capital in her
honor.
 Thinking of his queen, Malfurion suddenly beheld the palace itself, a magnificent structure surrounded by
a huge, well-guarded wall. He frowned, knowing it well. This was, of course, the grand abode of his
queen. Even though he had at times made mention of what he believed to be her faults, Malfurion actually
admired her more than most thought. Overall, she had done much good for her people, but on occasion
he believed Azshara simply lost her focus. As with many other night elves, he suspected any problem
there had to do in part with the Highborne, who administered the realm in her name.
 The wrongness grew worse the nearer he floated down toward the palace. Malfurion’s eyes widened as
he saw the reason. With the summoning of the vision of Zin-Azshari, he had also summoned a more
immediate image of the Well. The black lake now swirled madly and what appeared to be monstrous
strands of multicolored energy shot up from its depths. Powerful magic was being drawn from the Well
into the highest tower, its only possible purpose the casting of a spell of impossible proportions.
 The dark waters beyond the palace moved with such violence that to Malfurion they seemed to be
boiling. The more those within the tower summoned the might of the Well, the more terrible the fury of
the elements. Above, the storm-wracked heavens screamed and flashed. Some of the buildings near the
edge of the Well threatened to be washed away.
 What are they doing?Malfurion wondered, his own quest forgotten.Why do they continue even during
weakness of day?
 But “day” was only a term, now. Gone was the sun that dampened the night elves’ abilities. Even though
evening had not yet come, it was as black as night above Zin-Azshari…no, even blacker. This was not
natural and certainly not safe. What could those within be toying with?
 He drifted over the walls, past stone-faced guards ignorant of his presence. Malfurion floated to the
palace itself, but when he sought to enter, certain that his dream form would pass through something so
simple as stone, the night elf discovered an impenetrable barrier.
 Someone had encased the palace in protective spells so intricate, so powerful, that he could not pierce
them. This only made Malfurion more curious, more determined. He swooped around the structure, rising
again toward the tower in question. There had to be a way in. He had to see what madness was going on
inside.
 With one hand, he reached out to the array of protective spells, seeking the point that bound them all
together, the point by which they could also be unbound—
 And suddenly pain unimaginable wracked Malfurion. He screamed silently, no sound able to voice his
agony. The image of the palace, of Zin-Azshari, vanished. He found himself in an emerald void, caught
within a storm of pure magic. The elemental powers threatened to rip his dream form into a thousand
pieces and scatter them in every direction.
 But in the midst of the monstrous chaos, he suddenly heard the faint calling of a familiar voice.
 Malfurion…my child…come back to me…Malfurion…you must return…
 Vaguely the night elf recognized Cenarius’s desperate summons. He clung to it as a drowning person in
the middle of the sea might cling to a tiny piece of driftwood. Malfurion felt the woodland deity’s mind
reach out to him, guide him in the proper direction.
 The pain began to lessen, but Malfurion was exhausted beyond measure. A part of him simply wanted to
drift among the dreamers, his soul never returning to his flesh. Yet, he realized that to do so would mean
his end and so he fought against the deadly desire.
 And as the pain dwindled away, as Cenarius’s touch grew stronger, Malfurion sensed his own link to his
mortal form. Eagerly he followed it, moving faster and faster through the Emerald Dream…
 With a gasp…the young night elf awoke.
 Unable to stop himself, Malfurion tumbled into the grass. Mighty yet still gentle hands picked him back
up to a sitting position. Water dribbled into his mouth.
 He opened his eyes and beheld Cenarius’s concerned visage. His mentor held Malfurion’s own water
sack.
 “You have done what few others could do,” the stag god murmured. “And in doing so, you almost lost
yourself forever. What happened to you, Malfurion? You went even beyond my sight…”
 “I…I sensed…something terrible…”
 “The cause of your nightmares?”
 The night elf shook his head. “No…I don’t know…I…I found myself drawn to Zin-Azshari…” He tried
to explain what he had witnessed, but the words seem so insufficient.
 Cenarius looked even more disturbed than he, which worried Malfurion. “This does not bode well…no.
You are certain it was the palace? It had to be Azshara and her Highborne?”
 “I don’t know if one or both…but I can’t help feeling that the queen must be a part of it. Azshara is too
strong-willed. Even Xavius can’t control her…I think.” The queen’s counselor was an enigmatic figure,
as distrusted as Azshara was loved.
 “You must think about what you say, young Malfurion. You are suggesting that the ruler of the night
elves, she whose name is heard in song each day, is involved in some spellwork that could be a threat not
only to your kind, but the rest of the world. Do you understand what that means?”
 The image of Zin-Azshari intermingled with the scene of devastation…and Malfurion found both
compatible with each other. They might not be directly linked, but they shared something in common.
What that was, though, he did not know yet.
 “I understand one thing,” he muttered, recalling the perfect, beautiful face of his queen and the cheers
that accompanied even her briefest appearances. “I understand that I must find out the truth wherever
that truth leads…even if in the end it costs me my very life…”

 The shadowed form touched with his talon the small, golden sphere in his other scaled palm, bringing it
to life. Within it, there materialized another, almost identical shadow. The light from the sphere did nothing
to push back the darkness surrounding the figure, just as on the other end the sphere used by the second
form also failed. The magic cast to preserve each one’s identity was old and very strong.
 “The Well is still in the midst of terrible throes,” commented the one who had initiated contact.
 “So it has been for some time,” replied the second, tail flicking behind him. “The night elves play with
powers they do not appreciate.”
 “Has there been an opinion formed on your end?”
 The darkened head within the sphere shook once.
 “Nothing significant so far…but what can they possibly do save perhaps destroy themselves? It would
not be the first time one of the ephemeral races did so and surely not the last.”
 The first nodded. “So it seems to us…and the others.”
 “All the others?” hissed the second, for the first time some true curiosity in his tone. “Even those of the
Earth Warder’s flight?”
 “No…they keep their own counsel…as usual of late. They are little more than Neltharion’s reflection.”
 “Unimportant, then. Like you, we shall continue to monitor the night elves’ folly, but it is doubtful that it
will amount to much more than the extinction of their kind. Should it prove to be more, we shall act if we
are ordered to act by our lord, Malygos.”
 “The pact remains unbroken,” responded the first. “We, too, shall act only if commanded by her
majesty, the glorious Alexstrasza.”
 “This conversation is over, then.” With that, the sphere went black. The second form had severed the
link.
 The other rose, dismissing the sphere. With a hiss, he shook his head at the ignorance of the lesser races.
They constantly meddled in things beyond their capabilities and so often paid fatally for it. Their mistakes
were their own to suffer, so long as the world as a whole did not suffer with them. If that happened, then
the dragons would have to act.
 “Foolish, foolish night elvesss…”

 But in a place between worlds, in the midst of chaos incarnate, eyes of fire turned in sudden interest, the
work of the Azshara’s Highborne having also reached them.
 Somewhere, the one who gazed realized, somewhere someone had called upon the power. Someone
had drawn from the magic in the mistaken belief that they and they alone knew of it, knew how to wield
it…but where?
 He searched, almost had the source, then lost it. It was near, though, very near.
 He would wait. Like the others, he had begun to grow hungry again. Surely if he waited a little longer, he
would sense exactly where among the worlds the casters were. He smelled their eagerness, their
ambition. They would not be able to stop drawing from the magic. Soon…soon he would find the way
through to their little world…
 And he and the rest wouldfeed.
 FIVE
 Brox had a bad, bad feeling about their mission.
 “Where are they?” he muttered. “Where are they?”
 How did one hide a dragon, the orc wanted to know. The tracks were evident to a point, but then all he
and Gaskal could find afterward were the footprints of a human, possibly two. Since the orcs were near
enough to notice if a dragon launched itself into the air—and they had seen no such astonishing
sight—then it only made sense that the leviathan had to be nearby.
 “Maybe that way,” suggested the younger warrior, his brow furrowed deep. “That pass.”
 “Too narrow,” growled Brox. He sniffed the air. The scent of dragon filled his nostrils. Almost masked
by it was the smell of human. Dragons and wizards.
 Treaty or no treaty, this would be a good day to die…if Brox could just find his foes.
 Kneeling down to study the tracks better, the veteran had to admit that Gaskal’s suggestion made the
most sense. The two sets of tracks led into the narrow pass while the dragon’s simplyvanished. Still, if the
orcs confronted the other intruders, the beast would surely come.
 Not giving his companion any sign as to his true intentions, the older warrior rose. “Let’s go.”
 Weapons ready, they trotted into the pass. Brox snorted as he looked it over. Definitely too narrow for
a dragon, even a half-grown one. Wherewas the beast?
 They had only gone a short distance when from further in they heard the monstrous howl of a beast. The
two orcs glanced at each other, but did not slow. No true warrior turned at the first sound of danger.
 Deeper they went. The shadows played games, making it seem as if unnatural creatures lurked all
around them. Brox’s breathing grew heavier as he sought to keep pace with Gaskal. His ax weighed
heavily in his hand.
 A shout—a human shout—echoed from only a short distance ahead.
 “Brox—” the younger orc began.
 But at that moment, a monstrous vision filled their view, a fiery image like nothing either had ever seen.
 It filled the pass, overflowing even into the rock. It did not seem alive, but nonetheless moved as if with
purpose. Sounds—random, chaotic sounds—filled the orcs’ ears and when Brox stared into the center,
he felt as if he stared into Forever.
 Orcs were not creatures subject to easy fear, but the monstrous and surely magical vision overwhelmed
the two warriors. Brox and Gaskal froze before it, aware that simple weapons would hardly turn it aside.
 Brox had desired a heroic death, not one such as this. There was no nobility in dying so. The thing
looked capable of swallowing him as readily and without notice as it would a gnat.
 And that made his decision for him. “Gaskal! Move! Run!”
 Yet Brox himself failed to follow his own command. He turned to run, yes, but slipped like an awkward
infant in the slick snow. The huge orc tumbled to the ground, striking his head. His weapon fell just out of
reach.
 Gaskal, unaware of what had happened to his comrade, had not fled back, but rather darted to the side,
to a depression in one of the walls. There he planted himself inside, certain of the protection of the solid
rock.
 Still trying to clear his head, Brox realized Gaskal’s mistake. Rising to his knees, he shouted, “Not there!
Away!”
 But the cacophony of sounds drowned out his warning. The fearsome anomaly moved forward…and
Brox watched with horror as Gaskal was caught on its very edge.
 A thousand screams escaped the stricken orc as Gaskal both aged and grew younger simultaneously.
Gaskal’s eyes bulged and his body rippled like liquid. He stretched and contracted…
 And with a last ungodly cry, the younger orc shriveled within himself, contracting more and more…until
he completely vanished.
 “By the Horde…” Brox gasped, standing. He stared at the spot where Gaskal had stood, still somehow
hoping that his companion would miraculously reappear unharmed.
 Then it finally sank in that he was seconds from being engulfed by the same monstrosity.
 Brox turned, instinctively seized his ax, and ran. He felt no shame in it. No orc could fight this. To die as
Gaskal had died would be a futile gesture.
 But as fast as the orc ran, the fiery vision moved faster. Nearly deafened by the countless sounds and
voices, Brox gritted his teeth. He knew he could not outpace it, not now, but he continued to try…
 He managed only two steps more before it swallowed him whole.
 * * *
 Every bone, every muscle, every nerve in Krasus’s body screamed. It was the only reason the dragon
mage finally stirred from the black abyss of unconsciousness.
 What had happened? He still did not quite know. One minute, he had been trying to reach Rhonin—and
then somehow despite not being near it he, too, had been swallowed by the anomaly. His mental link to
the human wizard had literally dragged Krasus along.
 Images flashed through his befuddled mind again. Landscapes, creatures, artifacts. Krasus had
witnessed time in its ultimate aspect, all at once.
 Aspect?That word summoned another dread vision, one he had thankfully forgotten until now. In the
midst of the swirling chaos of time, Krasus had glimpsed a sight that left his heart and hope shattered.
 There, in the center of the fury, he had seen Nozdormu, the great Aspect of Time…trapped like a fly in
a web.
 Nozdormu had been there in all his terrible glory, a vast dragon not of flesh, but of the golden sands of
eternity. His glittering, gemlike eyes, eyes the color of the sun, had been open wide, but had not in turn
seen the insignificant figure of Krasus. The great dragon had been in the throes of both battle and agony,
ensnared yet also fighting to hold everything together—absolutelyeverything.
 Nozdormu was both victim and savior. Trapped in all time, he also held it from falling apart. If not for the
Aspect, the fabric of reality would have collapsed there and then. The world Krasus knew would have
disappeared forever. It would never have even existed.
 A new surge of pain tore through Krasus. He cried out in the ancient tongue of the dragons, momentarily
losing his accustomed control. Yet, with the pain came the realization that he still lived. That knowledge
caused him to fight, to force himself back to full consciousness…
 He opened his eyes.
 Trees greeted his gaze. Towering, lush trees with green canopies that nearly blotted out the sky. A forest
in the bloom of life. Birds sang while other creatures rustled and scurried through the underbrush.
Vaguely Krasus registered the setting sun and soft, drifting clouds.
 So peaceful a landscape, the dragon mage almost wondered if he had after all died and gone to the
beyond. Then, a not so heavenly sound, a muttered curse, caught his attention. Krasus looked to his left.
 Rhonin rubbed the back of his head as he tried to force himself up slightly. The fiery-haired human had
landed face-down only a few yards from his former mentor. The wizard spat out bits of dirt and grass,
then blinked. By pure accident, he looked in Krasus’s direction first.
 “What—?” was all he managed.
 Krasus tried to speak but all that came from his own mouth at first was a sick croak. He swallowed,
then tried again.
 “I…do not know. Are you…are you injured in any way?”
 Flexing his arms and legs, Rhonin grimaced. “Everything hurts…but…but nothing seems broken.”
 After a similar test, the dragon mage came to the same conclusion concerning himself. That they had
arrived so intact astonished him…but then he recalled the magic of Nozdormu at work in the anomaly.
Perhaps the Aspect of Time had noted them after all and done what he could to save the two.
 But if that was the case…
 Rhonin rolled onto his back. “Where are we?”
 “I cannot say. I feel I should know it, but—” Krasus stopped as vertigo suddenly seized hold of him. He
fell back onto the ground, closing his eyes until the feeling passed.
 “Krasus? What happened?”
 “Nothing truly…I believe. I am still not recovered from what happened. My weakness will go away.”
Yet, he noted that Rhonin already appeared much better, even sitting up and trying to stretch. Why
would a frail human better survive the anomaly’s turmoil than he?
 With grim determination, Krasus also sat up. The vertigo sought to overwhelm him again, but the dragon
mage fought it down. Trying to take his mind from his troubles, he looked around once more. Yes, he
certainly sensed a familiarity about his surroundings. At some point, he had visited this region, but when?
 When?
 The simple question filled him with a sudden dread.When…
 Nozdormu trapped in eternity…all time open to the anomaly…
 The thick woods and the growing shadows created by the vanishing sun made it virtually impossible to
see enough to identify the land. He would have to take to the air. Surely a short flight would be safe. The
area seemed bereft of any settlement.
 “Rhonin, remain here. I will scout from above, then return shortly.”
 “Is that wise?”
 “I think it absolutely necessary.” Without a further word, Krasus stretched out his arms and began
transforming.
 Or rather, hetried to transform. Instead, the dragon mage doubled over in agony and overwhelming
weakness. His entire body felt turned inside out and he lost all sense of balance.
 Strong arms caught him just as he fell. Rhonin carefully dragged him to a soft spot, then helped his
companion down.
 “Are you all right? You looked as if—”
 Krasus cut him off. “Rhonin…I could not change. I could not change…”
 The young wizard frowned, not comprehending. “You’re still weak, Master Krasus. The trip through
that thing—”
 “Yet, you are standing. Take no offense from me, human, but what we passed through should have left
you in a far worse state than mine.”
 The other nodded, understanding. “I just figured that you spent yourself trying to keep me alive.”
 “I am afraid to tell you that once we entered it, I could do no more for you than I could for myself. In
fact, if not for Nozdormu—”
 “Nozdormu?” Rhonin’s eyes widened. “What’s he got to do with our survival?”
 “You did not see him?”
 “No.”
 Exhaling, the dragon mage described what he had seen. As he did, Rhonin’s expression grew
increasingly grim.
 “Impossible…” the human finally breathed.
 “Terrifying,” Krasus corrected him. “And now I must tell you also that, even if Nozdormu did save us
from the raw forces of the anomaly, I fear he did not send us back to where we came from…or even
when.”
 “You think…you think we’re in a different time?”
 “Yes…but as to what period…I cannot say. I also cannot say how we will be able to get back to our
own era.”
 Slumping back, Rhonin gazed into empty space. “Vereesa…”
 “Have courage! I said I cannot say how we will be able to get back, but that does not mean that we will
not try! Still, our first action must be to find sustenance and shelter…and some knowledge of the land. If
we can place ourselves, we might be able to calculate where best to find the assistance we need. Now,
help me up.”
 With the human’s aid, Krasus stood. After a few tentative steps, he decreed himself well enough to
walk. A short discussion on which direction to take ended with agreement to head north, toward some
distant hills. There the two might be able to see far enough over the trees the next day to sight some
village or town.
 The sun fell below the horizon barely an hour into their trek, but the pair continued on. Fortunately,
Rhonin had in one of his belt pouches some bits of travel food and a bush they passed supplied them with
a few handfuls of edible if sour berries. In addition, the smaller, almost elven form Krasus wore required
far less food than his true shape. Still, both were aware that come the next day they would have to find
more substantial fare if they were to survive.
 The thicker garments used for the mountains proved perfect to keep them warm once darkness reigned.
Krasus’s superior vision also enabled them to avoid some pitfalls in their path. Still, the going was slow
and thirst began to take its toll on the pair.
 Finally, a slight trickling sound to the west led them to a small stream. Rhonin and Krasus knelt gratefully
and began to drink.
 “Thank the Five,” the dragon mage said as they drank. Rhonin nodded silently, too busy trying to
swallow the entire stream.
 After they had their fill, the two sat back. Krasus wanted to go on, but neither he nor the human clearly
had the strength to do so. They would have to rest for the night here, then continue on at first light.
 He suggested as much to Rhonin, who readily agreed. “I don’t think I could go another step,” the wizard
added. “But I think I can still create a fire if you like.”
 The idea of a fire enticed Krasus, but something inside him warned against it. “We shall be warm enough
in our garments. I would prefer to err on the side of caution for now.”
 “You’re probably right. We could be in the time of the Horde’s first invasion for all we know.”
 That seemed a bit unlikely to Krasus considering the peacefulness of the woods, but the centuries had
produced other dangers. Fortunately, their present location would keep them fairly secreted from most
creatures passing near. A rising slope also gave them a natural wall to hide behind.
 More out of exhaustion than agreement, they stayed where they were, literally falling asleep on the spot.
Krasus’s slumber, however, was a troubled one in which his dreams reflected events.
 Again he saw Nozdormu struggling against that which was his very nature. He saw all time tangled,
confused, and growing more unstable each moment the anomaly existed.
 Krasus saw something else, too, a faint, fiery glare, almost like eyes, gazing hungrily on all it saw. The
dragon mage frowned in his sleep as his subconscious tried to recollect why such an image would seem
so terribly familiar…
 But then the slight clink of metal against metal intruded, ripping apart his dreams and scattering the bits
away just as Krasus was on the verge of remembering what the burning eyes represented.
 Even as he stirred, Rhonin’s hand clamped over his mouth. Early in his long, long life, such an affront
would have made the dragon teach the mortal creature a painful lesson in manners, but now Krasus not
only had more patience than in his youth, he also had more trust.
 Sure enough, the clink of metal again sounded. So very slight, but to the trained ears of either spellcaster,
still like thunder.
 Rhonin pointed upward. Krasus nodded. Both cautiously stood, trying to see over the slope. Hours had
clearly passed since they had fallen asleep. The woods were silent save for the songs of a few insects. If
not for the brief, unnatural sounds they had heard, Krasus would have thought nothing amiss.
 Then a pair of large, almost monstrous shapes materialized beyond the slope. At first they were
unrecognizable, but then Krasus’s superior vision identified them as not two creatures, but ratherfour.
 A pair of riders atop long, muscular panthers.
 They were tall, very lean, but clearly warriors. They were clad in armor the color of the night and wore
high, crested helms with nose guards. Krasus could not yet make out their faces, but they moved with a
fluidity he did not see in most humans. Both the riders and their sleek, black mounts journeyed along as if
little troubled by the darkness, which made the dragon mage quickly caution his companion.
 “They will see you before you clearly see them,” Krasus whispered. “What they are, I do not know, but
they are not of your kind.”
 “There’s more!” Rhonin returned. Despite his inferior vision, he had been gazing in just the right direction
to catch another pair of riders approaching.
 The four soldiers moved in almost complete silence. Only the occasional breath from an animal or
metallic movement gave any sign of their presence. They looked to be involved in an intense hunt…
 Krasus came to the dread conclusion that they were looking for Rhonin and him.
 One of the foremost riders reined his monstrous, saber-toothed mount to a halt, then raised his hand to
his face. A small flash of blue light briefly illuminated the area around him. In his gauntleted hand the rider
held a small crystal, which he focused on the dark landscape. After a moment, he cupped the artifact with
his other hand, dousing the light.
 The use of the magical crystal only partly bothered Krasus. What little he had seen of the hunter’s
scowling, violet countenance worried him far more.
 “Night elves…”he whispered.
 The rider wielding the crystal instantly looked Krasus’s way.
 “They’ve seen us!” muttered Rhonin.
 Cursing himself for a fool, Krasus pulled the wizard with him. “Into the deeper woods! It is our only
hope!”
 A single shout echoed through the night…and then the woods filled with riders. Their fearsome yet agile
mounts leapt nimbly along, padded feet making no sound as the beasts moved. Like their masters, they
had gleaming, silver eyes that enabled them to see their quarry well despite the darkness. The panthers
roared lustily, eager to reach the prey.
 Rhonin and Krasus slid down a hill and into a thicket. One rider raced past them, but another turned and
continued pursuit. Behind them, more than a dozen other riders spread out through the area, intending to
cut off their quarry.
 The two reached the denser area, but the lead rider was nearly upon them. Turning about, Rhonin
shouted a single word.
 A blinding ball of pure force struck the night elf square in the chest, sending him flying back off his steed
and into the trunk of a tree with a resounding crash.
 The powerful assault only served to make the others more determined to catch them. Despite the harder
going, the riders pushed their mounts on. Krasus glanced to the east and saw that others had already
made their way around the duo.
 Instinctively, he cast a spell of his own. Spoken in the language of pure magic, it should have created a
wall of flame that would have kept their pursuers at bay. Instead, small bonfires burst to life in random
locations, most of them useless as any defense. At best, they served only as momentary distractions to a
handful of the riders. Most of the night elves did not even pay them any mind.
 Worse, Krasus doubled over in renewed pain and weakness.
 Rhonin came to the rescue again. He repeated a weaker variation of the dragon mage’s spell, but where
Krasus had received for his efforts lackluster results and physical agony, the human wizard garnered an
unexpected bounty. The woods before their pursuers exploded with hungry, robust flames, driving the
armored riders back in complete disarray.
 Rhonin looked as startled at the results as the night elves, but managed to recover quicker. He came to
Krasus’s side and helped the stricken mage retreat from the scene.
 “They will—” Krasus had to gasp for breath. “They will find a path around soon! They know this place
well from the looks of it!”
 “What did you call them?”
 “They are night elves, Rhonin. You recall them?”
 Both dragon mage and human had spent their part in the war against the Burning Legion near or in
Dalaran, but tales had come from far off of the appearance of the night elves, the legendary race from
which Vereesa’s kind was descended. The night elves had appeared when disaster had seemed imminent
and it was no understatement to say that the outcome might have been different if they had not joined the
defenders.
 “But if these are night elves, then aren’t we allies?”
 “You forget that we are not necessarily in the same time period. In fact, until their reappearance, it was
thought by even the dragons that their kind had become extinct after the end of—” Krasus became very
subdued, not at all certain he wanted to follow his thoughts to their logical conclusion.
 Shouts erupted nearby. Three riders closed on them, curved swords raised. In the lead rode the one
who wielded the blue crystal. Rhonin’s flames illuminated his face, the handsomeness typical of any elf
forever ruined by a severe scar running down the left side from near the eye to the lip.
 Krasus tried to cast another spell, but it only served to send him to his knees. Rhonin guided him down,
then faced the attackers.
 “Rytonus Zerak!”he shouted.
 The branches nearest the night elves suddenly clustered, forming a weblike barrier. One rider became
tangled in them and slipped from his mount. A second reined his protesting panther to a halt behind the
one caught.
 Their leader sliced through the branches as if cutting air, his blade leaving a streak of red lightning in its
deadly wake.
 “Rhonin!” Krasus managed. “Flee! Leave!”
 His former student had as little intention of obeying such a command as the dragon mage would have in
his place. Rhonin reached into his belt pouch and from it drew what first looked like a band of glowing
quicksilver. The quicksilver swiftly coalesced into a gleaming blade, a gift to Rhonin from an elven
commander at the end of the war.
 In the light of the wizard’s blade, the haughty expression of the night elves’ leader transformed into
surprise. Nonetheless, he met Rhonin’s sword with his own.
 Crimson and silver sparks flared. Rhonin’s entire body shook. The night elf nearly slipped from the
saddle. The panther roared, but because of his rider could not reach their foe with his razor-sharp claws.
 They traded blows again. A wizard Rhonin might be, but he had learned over his life the value of being
able to fight by hand. Vereesa had trained him so that even among seasoned warriors he could hold his
own…and with the elven blade he stood a good chance of success against any one foe.
 But not against many. Even as he kept both night elf and beast at bay, three more riders arrived, two
manipulating a net. Krasus heard a sound from behind him and glanced over his shoulder to see three
more coming, also bearing a huge net.
 Try as he might, he could not get the words of power out. He, a dragon, was helpless.
 Rhonin saw the first net and backed up. He held the sword ready in case the night elves tried to snare
him. The leader urged his mount forward, keeping Rhonin’s attention.
 “B-behind you!” Krasus called, the weakness overcoming him again. “There’s another—”
 A booted foot kicked the weakened mage in the side of the head. Krasus retained consciousness, but
could not focus.
 Through bleary eyes, he watched as the dark forms of the night elves closed in on his companion.
Rhonin fended off a pair of blades, chased back one of the huge cats…and then the net caught him from
behind.
 He managed to sever one section, but the second net fell over him, entangling Rhonin completely. Rhonin
opened his mouth, but the lead rider moved up and struck him hard across the jaw with his gauntleted
fist.
 The human wizard dropped.
 Enraged, Krasus managed to pull himself partway from his stupor. He muttered and pointed at the
leader.
 His spell worked this time, but went astray. A bolt of golden lightning struck not the target in question,
but rather a tree near one of the other hunters. Three large limbs ripped free, collapsing on one rider and
crushing both him and his mount.
 The lead night elf glared in Krasus’s direction. The dragon mage tried futilely to protect himself as fists
and boots pummeled him into submission…and finally unconsciousness.

 He watched as his subordinates beat at the peculiar figure who had, more by chance than by skill, slain
one of their own. Long after it was clear their victim had lost all sense, he let his warriors take out their
frustration on the unmoving body. The panthers hissed and growled, smelling blood, and it was all the
night elves could do to keep them from joining in the violence.
 When he judged that they had reached the limits of safety, that any further beating would jeopardize the
life of their prisoner, he gave the command to halt.
 “Lord Xavius wants all alive,” the scarred night elf snapped. “We don’t want him disappointed, do we?”
 The others straightened, fear abruptly appearing in their eyes. Well they might fear, he thought, for Lord
Xavius had a tendency to reward carelessness with death…painful, lingering death.
 And often he chose the willing hand of Varo’then to deal out that death.
 “We were careful, Captain Varo’then,” one of the soldiers quickly insisted. “They will both survive the
journey…”
 The captain nodded. It still amazed him how the queen’s counselor had even detected the presence of
these unusual strangers. All Xavius had said when he had summoned faithful Varo’then was that there
had been some sort of odd manifestation and that he wanted the captain to investigate and bring back
anyone unusual discovered in the vicinity. Varo’then, ever sharp-eyed, had noticed the slight furrowing of
the lord’s brow, the only hint that Xavius was more disturbed about this unknown “manifestation” than he
hinted.
 Varo’then eyed the prisoners as their bound bodies were draped unceremoniously over one of the
panthers. Whatever the counselor had expected, it surely did not include a pair such as this. The weak
one who had managed the last spell looked vaguely like a night elf, but his skin was pale, almost white.
The other one, obviously a younger and far more talented spellcaster…Varo’then did not know what to
make of him. He was not unlike a night elf…but was clearly not. He looked like no creature the veteran
soldier had ever seen.
 “No matter. Lord Xavius will sort it all out,” Varo’then murmured to himself. “Even if he has to tear them
limb from limb or flay them alive to get the truth…”
 And whichever course the counselor took, good, loyal Captain Varo’then would be there to lend his
experienced hand.
 SIX
 It was a troubled Malfurion who returned to his home near the roaring falls just beyond the large night
elven settlement of Suramar. He had chosen the site because of the tranquility and untransformed nature
around the falls. Nowhere else did he feel so at peace, save perhaps in Cenarius’s hidden grove.
 A low-set, rounded domicile formed from both tree and earth, Malfurion’s simple home was a far
contrast from those of most night elves. Not for him was the gaudy array of colors that bespoke of his
kind’s tendency to try to out-shine one another. The colors of his home were those of earth and life, the
forest greens, the rich, fertile browns, and kindred shades. He tried to adapt to his surroundings, not
force them to adapt to him as was his people’s way.
 Yet nothing about his home gave Malfurion any sense of comfort this night. Still fiercely clear in his mind
were the thoughts and images he had experienced while walking the Emerald Dream. They had opened
up doors in his imagination he wished desperately to shut again, but knew would be impossible.
 “The visions you see in the Emerald Dream, they can mean many things,” Cenarius had insisted, “no
matter how true they might look. Even what we think is real—such as your view of Zin-Azshari—may
not be so, for the dreamland plays its own games on our limited minds…”
 Malfurion knew that the demigod had only been trying to assuage him, that what the night elf saw had
been truth. He understood that Cenarius was actually as concerned about the reckless spellcasting taking
place in the palace of Azshara as his student was.
 The power that the Highborne had been summoning…what could it be for? Did they not sense how
stressed the fabric of the world had grown near the Well? It was still unfathomable to him that the queen
could condone such careless and possibly destructive work…and yet Malfurion could not shake the
certainty that she was as much a part of it as any of her subordinates. Azshara was no simple figurehead;
she truly ruled, even when it came to her arrogant Highborne.
 He tried to return to his normal routine, hoping that would help him forget his troubles. There were but
three rooms to the young night elf’s home, yet another example of the simplicity of his life compared to
that of others. In one stood his bed and the handful of books and scrolls he had gathered concerning
nature and his recent studies. In another, toward the back, was the larder and a small, plain table where
he prepared his meals.
 Malfurion considered both rooms nothing more than necessities. The third, the communal room, was
ever his favored place. Here where the light of the moon shone bright at night and the glistening waters of
the falls could be seen, he sat in the center and meditated. Here, with a sip of the honey-nectar wine so
favored by his kind, he looked over his work and tried to comprehend what Cenarius had taught him the
lesson before. Here, by the short, ivory table where a meal could be spread out, he also visited with
Tyrande and Illidan.
 But there would be no Tyrande or Illidan this evening. Tyrande had returned to the temple of Elune to
continue her own studies and Malfurion’s twin, in what was another sign of their growing dissimilarities,
now preferred the raucousness of Suramar to the serenity of the forest.
 Malfurion leaned back, his face agleam in the light of the moon. He shut his eyes to think, hoping to calm
his nerves—
 No sooner had he done so, though, when something large moved across the field of moonlight, briefly
putting Malfurion in total darkness.
 The night elf’s eyes snapped open just in time to catch a glimpse of a huge, ominous form. Malfurion
immediately leapt to the door and flung it open.
 But to his surprise, only the rushing waters of the nearby falls met his tense gaze.
 He stepped outside, peered around. Surely no creature so large could move so fast. The bullish Tauren
and ursine Furbolgs were not unknown to him, but while they matched in size the peculiar shadow,
neither of the two races was known for swiftness. A few branches rustled in the wind and a night bird
sang somewhere in the distance, but Malfurion could find no sign of his supposed intruder.
 Simply your own nerves,he finally chided himself.Your own uncertainties.
 Returning inside, Malfurion seated himself again, his mind already caught up once more in his troubles.
Unlike his phantom intruder, he was certain that he had not imagined or misread anything concerning the
palace and the Well. Somehow, Malfurion would have to learn more, more than the Emerald Dream
could at present reveal to him.
 And, he suspected, he would have to do it very, very quickly.
 * * *
 He had almost been caught. Like an infant barely able to walk, he had almost lumbered right into the
creature’s lair. Hardly a worthy display of the well-honed skills for which a veteran orc warrior was
known.
 Brox had not worried about his ability to defend himself had the creature caught him, but now was not
the time to give in to his own desire to meet a glorious finish. Besides, from what he had seen of the lone
figure, it would hardly have been a good match. Tall, but too spindly, too unprotected. Humans were
much more interesting and worthy opponents…
 Not for the first time his head throbbed. Brox put a hand to his temple, fighting the pain. A swirling
confusion reigned in his mind. What had happened to him in the past several hours, the orc still could not
say with complete certainty. Instead of being ripped apart like Gaskal as he had expected, he was
catapulted into madness. Things beyond the comprehension of a simple warrior had materialized and
vanished before his eyes and Brox recalled flying around in a swirl of chaotic forces, all while countless
voices and sounds had assailed him almost to the point of deafness.
 In the end, it had all proven too much. Brox had blacked out, certain he would never wake.
 He had, of course, but it was not to find himself safely back in the mountains or still trapped in the
insanity. Instead, Brox discovered himself in an almost tranquil landscape consisting of tall trees and
bucolic rolling hills for as far as the eye could see. The sun was setting and the only sounds of life were
the musical calls of birds.
 Even had he been dropped into the midst of a horrendous battle rather than this quiet scene, Brox could
have done nothing but lay where he was. It had taken the orc more than an hour to recover enough to
just stand, much less travel. Fortunately, during that anxious waiting time, Brox had discovered one
miracle. His ax, which he thought lost, had been swallowed with him and deposited but a few yards from
the orc. Not yet able to use his legs, Brox dragged himself to the weapon. He had not been able to wield
it, but clutching its handle had given him some comfort while he waited for his strength to return.
 The moment he was able to walk, Brox had quickly pushed on. It did not pay to stay in one place when
in a strange land, no matter how peaceful it looked. Situations always changed even in the most peaceful
places and, in his experience, generally not for the better.
 The orc tried to understand what had happened to him. He had heard of wizards traveling by means of
special spells from one location to another, but if this was such a spell, then the mage who had cast it
surely had to be insane. Either that, or the incantation had gone awry, certainly a possibility.
 Alone and lost, Brox’s instincts took over. No matter what had happened so far, Thrall would want him
to find out more about the inhabitants of this place and what their intentions might be. If they were
responsible by accident or design for reaching out with magic to the orcs’ new home- land, they posed a
possible threat. Brox could die later; his first duty was to protect his people.
 At least now he had some notion as to what race lived here. Brox had never seen or heard of a night elf
before the war against the Burning Legion, but he could never forget their unique looks. Somehow, he
had landed in some realm ruled by their kind, which at least opened to him the hope of returning home
once he gathered what information he could. The night elves had fought alongside the orcs in Kalimdor;
surely that meant that Brox had merely ended up on some obscure part of the continent. With a little
reconnaissance he was certain that he would be able to figure out which direction the orc lands were and
head to them.
 Brox had no intention of simply going up to one of the night elves and asking the way. Even if these were
the same creatures who had allied themselves with the orcs and humans, he could not be certain that
those of this land would be friendly to an intruder now. Until he knew more, the wary orc intended to
remain well out of sight.
 Although Brox did not immediately encounter any more such dwellings, he did note a glow in the
distance that likely originated from some larger settlement. After a moment’s consideration, the orc hefted
his weapon and pushed on toward it.
 Barely had he made that decision, however, when shadows suddenly approached from the opposite
direction. Pressing flat against a wide tree, Brox watched a pair of riders approach. His eyes narrowed in
surprise when, instead of good horses, he saw that they raced along on swift, gigantic panthers. The orc
gritted his teeth and readied himself in case either the riders or their beasts sensed him.
 But the armored figures hurried past as if determined to be somewhere quickly. They appeared quite
comfortable traveling in little light, which made the orc suddenly recall that night elves could see in
darkness as well as he could see in day.
 That did not bode well. Orcs had fair night vision, but not nearly as good as that of the night elves.
 He hefted his ax. Perhaps he did not have the advantage in terms of sight, but Brox would match himself
against any of the scrawny figures he had so far come across. Day or night, an ax in the hands of an orc
warrior skilled in its use would make the same deep, fatal cut. Even the elaborate armor he noted on the
riders would not long stand up to his beloved weapon.
 With the riders out of view, Brox continued on cautiously. He needed to find out more about these
particular night elves and the only way to do that was to spy on their settlement. There he might find out
enough to know where in relation to home he now wandered. Then he could return to Thrall. Thrall
would know what to make of all this. Thrall would deal with these night elves who dabbled in dangerous
magic.
 So very, very simple—
 He blinked, so caught up in his thoughts that he only now saw standing before him the tall female figure
clad in silver, moonlit robes.
 She looked as startled as the orc felt…then her mouth opened and the night elf cried out.
 Brox started to reach for her—his only intention that of smothering the scream—but before he could do
anything, other cries arose and night elves began appearing from every direction.
 A part of him desired to stand where he was and fight to the death, but the other part, that which served
Thrall, reminded him that this would achieve nothing. He would have failed in his mission, failed his
people.
 With a snarl of outrage, he turned and fled back in the direction he had come.
 Yet, now it seemed that from every huge tree trunk, from every rising mound, figures popped into
sight—and each let out the alarm at the sight of the burly orc.
 Horns blared. Brox swore, knowing what such a sound presaged. Sure enough, moments later, he heard
feline growls and determined shouts.
 Glancing over his shoulder, he saw his pursuers nearing. Unlike the pair he had hidden from earlier, most
of the new riders were clad only in robes and breast plates, but that hardly erased them as a threat. Each
was not only armed, but their mounts presented an even more dire danger. One swipe of a paw would
slice the orc open, one bite of the saber-toothed jaws would rip off his head.
 Brox wanted to take his ax and sweep across their ranks, chopping away at rider and mount alike and
leaving a trail of blood and maimed bodies behind him. Yet, despite his desire to lay waste to those who
threatened him, Thrall’s teachings and commands held such violence in check. Brox growled and met the
first riders with the flat of his ax head. He knocked one night elf from his mount, then, after dodging the
cat’s claws, turned to seize another rider by the leg. The orc threw the second night elf atop the first,
knocking the air out of both.
 A blade whistled by his head. Brox easily smashed the slim blade to fragments with his powerful ax. The
night elf wisely retreated, the stump of his weapon still gripped tightly.
 The orc took advantage of the gap created by the retreat to slip past his pursuers. Some of the night
elves did not look at all eager to follow, which raised Brox’s spirits. More than his own honor, Thrall’s
pride in his chosen warrior continued to keep Brox from turning and making a foolish last stand. He
would not let his chief down.
 But just as escape looked possible, another night elf materialized before him, this one dressed in
shimmering robes of brilliant green with gold and ruby starbursts dotting the chest. A cowl obscured most
of the night elf’s long, narrow visage, but he seemed undaunted by the huge, brutish orc coming up on
him.
 Brox waved his ax and shouted, trying to scare off the night elf.
 The hooded figure raised one hand to chest level, the index and middle fingers pointed toward the
moonlit sky.
 The orc recognized a spell being cast, but by that time it was already too late.
 To his astonishment, a circular sliver of the moon fell from the sky, falling upon Brox like a soft, misty
blanket. As it enshrouded him, the orc’s arms grew heavy and his legs weak. He had to fight to keep his
eyelids open.
 The ax slipping from his limp grasp, Brox fell to his knees. Through the silvery haze, he now saw other
similarly clad figures circling him. The hooded forms stood patiently, obviously watching the spell’s work.
 A sense of fury ignited Brox. With a low snarl, he managed to push himself up to his feet. This was not
the glorious death he had wanted! The night elves intended that he fall at their feet like a helpless infant!
He would not do it!
 Fumbling fingers managed to seize the ax again. To his pleasure, he noted some of the hooded figures
start. They had not expected such resistance.
 But as he tried to raise his weapon, a second silvery veil settled over him. What strength Brox had
summoned vanished again. When the ax fell this time, he knew he would be unable to retrieve it.
 The orc took one wobbly step, then fell forward. Even then, Brox tried to crawl toward his foes,
determined not to make their victory an easy one.
 A third veil dropped over him…and Brox blacked out.
 * * *
 Three nights…three nights and still nothing to show for our efforts…
 Xavius was not pleased.

 Three of the Highborne sorcerers stepped back from the continual spellwork. They were immediately
replaced by those who had managed to replenish their strength with some overdue rest. Xavius’s false
black eyes turned to the three who had just finished. One of them noticed the dark orbs gazing their
direction and cringed. The Highborne might be the most glorious of the queen’s servants, but Lord
Xavius was the most glorious—and dangerous—of the Highborne.
 “Tomorrow night…tomorrow night we shall increase the field of power tenfold,” he declared, the
crimson streaks in his eyes flaring.
 Unable to meet his gaze, one of the other Highborne nonetheless dared say, “W-with all due respect, my
Lord Xavius, that risks much! Such an additional increase may destabilize all we have already
accomplished.”
 “And what is that, Peroth’arn?” Xavius loomed over the other robed figures, his shadow seeming to
move of its own accord in the mad light of the spell. “Whathave we accomplished?”
 “Why, we command more power than any night elf has ever commanded before!”
 Xavius nodded, then frowned. “Yes, and with it, we can squash an insect with a mountain-sized
hammer! You are a shortsighted fool, Peroth’arn! Consider yourself fortunate that your skill is demanded
for this effort.”
 Clamping his mouth shut, the other night elf bowed his head gratefully.
 The queen’s counselor looked with disdain upon the rest of the Highborne. “What we seek to do, we
need perfect manipulation of the Well to accomplish! We must have the ability to slay the insect without
its even realizing the death until after the fact! We must have such precision, such a fine touch, that there
will be no question as to the perfect execution of our final goal! We—”
 “Preaching again, my darling Xavius?”
 The melodic voice would have enchanted any of the other Highborne into killing themselves if it would
please the speaker, but not so the onyx-eyed Xavius. With a careless gesture, he dismissed the weary
spellcasters, then turned to the one person in the palace who did not rightly show him the respect he
deserved.
 She glittered as she entered, a vision of perfection that his magical orbs amplified. She was the glory of
the night elves, their beloved mistress. When she breathed, she made the crowds breathless. When she
touched the cheek of a favored warrior, he went out and willingly fought dragons and more, even if it
meant his certain destruction.
 The queen of the night elves was tall for a female, taller even than many males. Only Xavius truly
towered above her. Yet, despite her height, she moved like the wind, silent grace with every step. No cat
walked as silently as Azshara and none walked with as much confidence.
 Her deep, violet skin was as smooth as the almost sheer silk garment she wore. Her hair, long, thick,
lush, and moonlight silver, cascaded down around her shoulders and artfully curved backside. In contrast
to her previous visit, when she had matched her garments to her eyes, she now wore a flowing gown the
same wondrous color as her luxurious hair.
 Even Xavius secretly desired her, but on his own terms. His ambitions drove him far more than her wiles
ever could. Still, he found much use in her presence, just as he knew she found the same in his. They
shared an ultimate objective, but with differing rewards for each waiting at the end.
 When that goal was finally reached, Xavius would show Azshara who truly ruled.
 “Light of the Moon,” he began, expression obedient. “I preach only of your purity, your flawlessness!
These others I simply remind of their duty—nay, of theirlove —for you. They should not therefore wish
to fail…”
 “For they would be failing you, as well, my darling counselor.” Behind the stunning queen, two
handmaidens carried the train of her long, translucent gown. They shifted the train to the side as Azshara
seated herself on the special chair she had made the Highborne erect so that she could watch their efforts
in comfort. “And I think they fear that more than they love me.”
 “Hardly, my mistress!”
 The queen positioned herself to gaze upon the struggling spellcasters, her gown shifting to best display
her perfect form.
 Xavius remained unmoved by her maneuver. He would have her and whatever else he desired after they
had succeeded in their great mission.
 A sudden flash of blazing light drew the eyes of both to the work of the sorcerers. Hovering in the center
of the circle created by the Highborne, a furious ball of energy continually remade itself. Its myriad
displays had a hypnotic effect, in great part because they often seemed to be opening up a doorway into
elsewhere. Xavius especially spent long hours staring into the night elves’ creation, seeing with his artificial
eyes what none of the others could.
 Watching now, the counselor wrinkled his brow. He squinted, studying the endless depths within. For
just the briefest of moments, he could have sworn that he had seen—
 “I believe you are not listening to me, darling Xavius! Is that at all possible?”
 He managed to recover. “As possible as living without breathing, Daughter of the Moon…but I admit I
was distracted enough that I may not have understood clearly. You said again something about—”
 A brief, throaty chuckle escaped Queen Azshara, but she did not contradict him. “What is there to
understand? I simply restated that surely we must soon triumph! Soon we shall have the power and
ability to cleanse our land of its imperfections, create of it the perfect paradise…”
 “So it shall be, my queen. So it shall be. We are but a short time from the creation of a grand golden
age. The realm—yourrealm—will be purified. The world will know everlasting glory!” Xavius allowed
himself a slight smile. “And the blighted, impure races that in the past have prevented such a perfect age
from issuing forth willcease to be.”
 Azshara rewarded his good words with a pleased smile of her own, then said, “I am glad to hear you
say that it will be soon. I have had more supplicants today, lord counselor. They came in fear of the
violence in and around the great Well. They asked me for guidance as to its cause and danger. Naturally,
I referred their requests to you.”
 “As you rightly should have, mistress. I will assuage their fears long enough for our precious task to
come to fruition. After that, it will be your pleasure to announce what has been done for the good of your
people…”
 “And they shall love me the more for it,” Azshara murmured, her eyes narrowed as if imagining the
grateful crowds.
 “If they could possibly love you any more than they do already, my glorious queen.”
 Azshara accepted his compliment with a momentary lowering of her slitted eyes, then, with a smooth
grace of which only she was capable, rose from the chair. Her attendants quickly manipulated the train of
her gown so that it would not in the slightest hamper her movements. “I will make the wondrous
announcement soon, Lord Xavius,” she declared, turning away from the counselor. “See to it that all is
ready when I do.”
 “It will consume my waking hours,” he replied, bowing to her retreating form. “And be the dreams of my
slumber.”
 But the moment she and her attendants had departed, a deep frown crossed the counselor’s cold visage.
He signaled to one of the stone-faced guards ever standing duty at the entrance to the chamber.
 “If I am not alerted before the next time her majesty decides to join us, it will be your head. Is that
understood?”
 “Yes, my lord,” the guard returned, expression never wavering.
 “I also expect to be notified of Captain Varo’then’s arrival before her majesty. His task is nothing with
which to sully her hands. Make certain that the captain—and whatever he brings with him—is led directly
to me.”
 “Yes, my lord.”
 Dismissing the guard, Xavius returned to the task of overseeing the Highborne’s spellwork.
 A lattice of dancing magical energy now enshrouded the fiery sphere, which continued to remake itself.
As Xavius watched, the sphere folded within, almost as if it attempted to devour itself.
 “Fascinating…” he whispered. This close, the lord counselor could feel the intense emanations, the
barely bound forces summoned up from the source of all the night elves’ magical might. It had been
Xavius who had first suspected that his kind had only so far skimmed the surface of the dark water’s
potential. The Well of Eternity was aptly named, for the more he studied it, the more he realized that its
bounty was endless. The physical dimensions of the Well were only a trick of the limited mind…the true
Well existed in a thousand dimensions, a thousand places, simultaneously.
 And from every aspect of it, every variation of it, the Highborne would learn to draw whatever they
pleased.
 The potential staggered even him.
 Energies and colors unseen even by the others danced and fought before Xavius’s magical eyes. They
drew him in, their elemental power seductive. The lord counselor drank in the fantastic sight before him—
 But from within, from deep beyond the physical world…he suddenly felt something stare back.
 This time, the night elf knew he was not mistaken. Xavius sensed a presence, a distant presence. Yet,
despite that incredible distance, the might he also sensed was staggering.
 He tried to pull back, but it was already too late. Deep, so very deep within the captured energies of the
Well, the mind of the counselor was suddenly dragged beyond the edge of reality, beyond
eternity…until…
 I have searched long for you…came the voice. It was life, death, creation, destruction…and power
infinite.
 Had he even desired to do so, Xavius would have been unable to wrench his eyes away from the abyss
within. Other eyes now snared his tightly…the eyes of the lord counselor’s newgod.
 And now you have come to me…

 The waters bubbled as if boiling. Great waves rose and crashed down time and time again. Lightning
flashed from both the heavens and the dark Well.
 Then came the whispers.
 The first of the night elves to hear them thought the sounds only the wild wind. They soon ignored them
completely, more concerned with the possible devastation of their elegant homes.
 A few more astute, more attuned to the Well’s unearthly energies, heard them for what they were.
Voices from the Well itself. But what the voices said, even the majority of those could not say.
 It was the one or two who heard clearly who truly
 feared…and yet did not speak of their fear to others, lest they be branded mad and cast out from their
society. Thus, they failed to heed the only warning they would truly get.
 The voices spoke of nothing but hunger. They hungered for everything. Life, energy, souls…they wanted
through to the world, through to the night elves’ pristine realm.
 And once there, they would devour it…
 SEVEN
 Their captors had grown very apprehensive…and to
 Rhonin, that made them even more of a threat.
 It had much to do with the new stretch of forest that they had just entered. This area felt different to
Rhonin compared to the dark stretches they had so far crossed. Here their captors seemed not so much
the lords of the land as they did undesired intruders.
 Dawn fast approached. He and Krasus, who appeared to still be unconscious, had been bound and
unceremoniously tossed onto the back of one of the animals. Each jostle by the huge panther threatened
to crack the wizard’s ribs, but he forced himself not to make any sound or movement that would reveal
to the night elves that he was awake.
 Yet, what did it matter if they knew? He had already tried several times to cast a spell, but for his
attempts had gained only a skull-splitting headache. Around his throat had been placed a small emerald
amulet, a simple-looking thing that was the source of his frustration. Whenever he tried to concentrate too
hard on his spells, his thoughts grew all muddled and his temples throbbed. He could not even shake the
amulet free. The night elves had secured it well. Krasus wore one also, but from him it seemed their
captors had nothing to fear. Rhonin also noted what had happened each time his former mentor had tried
to aid in the struggle. Krasus had even less mastery over his power than Rhonin, a disturbing notion.
 “This isn’t the path we took,” snarled the scarred leader, whom the human had heard referred to as
Varo’then. “This isn’t the way it should be…”
 “But we’ve followed it back exactly as we should’ve, my captain,” replied one of the others. “There was
no deviation—”
 “Does that look like the spires of Zin-Azshari on the horizon?” Varo’then snapped. “I see nothing but
more damned trees, Koltharius…and there’s something I don’t like about them, either! Somehow, even
with our eyes keen and our path understood, we’ve headed elsewhere!”
 “Should we turn back? Retrace our route?”
 Rhonin could not see the captain’s face, but he could imagine the frustrated expression. “No…no…not
yet…”
 Yet, while Varo’then was not yet ready to give up on the trail, the wizard was becoming concerned
about it himself. With each step deeper into the thick, towering forest, he sensed some growing presence,
a presence the likes of which Rhonin had never experienced before. In some ways, it reminded him of
how he sensed Krasus whenever the dragon mage contacted him, but this was more…much more.
 But what?
 “The sun’s nearly upon us,” muttered another of the soldiers.
 From what Rhonin had so far ascertained, while his captors could function in daylight, they did not like it.
In some ways, it weakened them. They were creatures of magic—even if individually they might not
wield much of it—but their magic had to do with the night. If he could just rid himself of the amulet once
the sun had risen, Rhonin believed the odds would swing back in his favor.
 Making certain that no one watched, he surreptitiously shook his head. The amulet swung back and
forth, but would not slip off. Rhonin finally tried thrusting his head up, hoping that might dislodge the
piece. He risked being noticed by his captors, but that was a chance he had to take.
 In the gloom of predawn, a face stared out at him from the nearby foliage.
 No…the face waspart of the foliage. The leaves and twigs formed the features, even creating a lush
beard. The eyes were berries and a gap between the greenery represented what looked like a
mischievous mouth.
 It vanished among the bushes as swiftly as it had appeared, making Rhonin wonder if he had simply
imagined it. A trick of the coming light? Impossible! Not with so much detail.
 And yet…
 The scrape of a weapon being drawn from its sheath caught his attention. One by one the night elves
readied themselves for some battle that they did not understand, but knew was coming. Even the fierce
cats sensed trouble, for not only did they pick up their already swift pace, but their backs arched and
they bared their savage teeth.
 Varo’then suddenly pointed to his right. “That way! That way! Quickly!”
 At that moment, the forest erupted with life.
 Huge, foliage-thick branches swung down, obscuring the faces of the riders. Bushes leapt up, becoming
short, nimble figures with silent, smiling faces of green. The forest floor seemed to snag the claws of every
panther, sending more than one rider tumbling. The night elves shouted recklessly at one another, trying
to organize themselves, instead only adding to the chaos.
 A low moan echoed through the vicinity. Rhonin caught only a glance, but felt certain that he had seen a
massive tree bend over and sweep away two of the night elves and their mounts with its thick, leafy
crown.
 Curses filled the forest as Varo’then tried to regain command of his party. Those elves who remained
mounted sat in a jumble, attempting not only to cut at the things swarming around them, but also to keep
their excited panthers under control. For all their size, the huge cats clearly did not like what they faced,
often pulling back even when their riders insisted that they move forward.
 Varo’then cried out something and suddenly harsh, violet tentacles of radiant energy darted out at
various points in the forest. One struck an approaching bush sprite, instantly turning the creature into an
inferno. Yet, despite its apparent horrible demise, the creature continued forward without pause, leaving
a burning trail in its wake.
 Almost immediately, the wind, which had been nearly nonexistent prior to this, howled and roared as if
angered by the assault. It blew with such fury that dirt, broken tree limbs, and loose leaves flew up in vast
numbers, filling the air and further obscuring the night elves’ view. The flames snuffed out, their would-be
victim as oblivious to this phenomenal rescue as it had been to its previous peril. A huge, flying branch
struck down the night elf next to Varo’then.
 “Regroup!” the scarred captain shouted. “Regroup and retreat! Hurry, blast you!”
 A leafy hand covered Rhonin’s mouth. He looked again into the same startling face. Behind him, he felt
other hands grasping his legs.
 With a rather unceremonious push, they sent the mage sliding forward.
 The panther took notice of this and roared. More of the small shrublike figures swarmed around the
beast, harassing it. As the world rocked around him, Rhonin caught sight of Varo’then twisting back to
see what was happening. The scowling elf swore as it registered that his prisoners were being stolen, but
before he could raise a hand to stop them, more branches came down, both entangling the captain’s arms
and face and blinding him.
 The bush creatures caught Rhonin well before he would have been in danger of striking the ground
headfirst. Silently and efficiently, they carried him like a battering ram into the thick forest. Rhonin could
only hope that Krasus, too, had been rescued, for he could see nothing but the leafy figure before him.
Despite their sizes, his companions were obviously strong.
 Then, to his dismay, a lone night elf atop a snarling panther cut off their path. The wizard recognized him
as the one called Koltharius. He had a desperate look in his eyes, as if Rhonin’s escape would mean the
worst for him. From what little Rhonin had learned of the captain, he did not doubt that.
 Wasting no words, the night elf urged his beast forward. The elves Rhonin knew, especially his own
beloved Vereesa, were beings with the utmost respect for nature. Koltharius’s kind, however, seemed
not to care a whit for it; he slashed at the tree limbs and shrubbery slowing him with unbridled fury.
Nothing would keep him from his prey.
 Or so he might have thought. Huge, black birds abruptly dropped from the foliage above, surrounding
and harassing the night elf mercilessly. Koltharius swung madly about, but severed not even a pinfeather
from his avian attackers.
 So engrossed was the night elf by this latest assault that he did not notice another danger rising up from
the earth. The trees through which he needed to pass rose by more than two feet, as if stretching their
roots.
 Koltharius’s mount, driven nearly to madness by the birds, did not pay enough attention to its course.
 The typically nimble feline first stumbled, then tripped badly as its paws became more and more
entangled. A mournful yowl escaped it as it flew sideways. Its rider tried to hold on, but that only served
to worsen his situation.
 The huge panther twisted, putting Koltharius between it and two massive tree trunks. Trapped, the night
elf was crushed between them, his armor crumpling like paper under the tremendous force. His cat
suffered little better, a terrible snapping sound at its neck accompanying the crash.
 Rhonin’s leafy companions moved on as if nothing had happened. For a few more minutes, the wizard
continued to hear the struggles of his former captors, but then the sounds suddenly shifted away, as if
Varo’then had finally led his bedraggled hunters to escape.
 On and on the tiny creatures carried him. He saw a movement to his right and made out what looked to
be the dragon mage’s still form being brought along in like fashion. For the first time, though, Rhonin
started to fear what his rescuers intended to do with the pair. Had they been taken from the night elves in
order to face some more horrific fate?
 The forest sprites slowed, finally halting at the edge of an open area. Despite the impossibility of the
angle, the first hints of daylight already lit up the opening. Small, delicate songbirds twittered merrily.
Myriad flowers of a hundred colors bloomed full and tall grass within waved gently, almost beckoningly,
to the newcomers.
 Again a leafy face filled his gaze. The open-gap smile widened and to his surprise Rhonin saw that a
small, utterly white flower bloomed within.
 A tiny puff of pollen shot forth, splattering the human’s nose and mouth.
 Rhonin coughed. His head swam. He felt the creatures move again, carrying him into the sunlight.
 But before one ray could touch his face…the wizard passed out.

 Despite Rhonin’s belief otherwise, Krasus had not been unconscious most of the time. Weak, yes,
almost willing to let the darkness take him, true, but the dragon mage had fought both his physical and
mental debilitation and, if not a victor, he had at least suffered no defeat.
 Krasus, too, had noticed watchers in the woods, but he immediately recognized them as servants of the
forest. With senses still more attuned than those of his human companion, Krasus understood that the
night elves had beendrawn to this place purposely. Some force desired something of the armored figures
and it took no leap of logic to assume that he and Rhonin were the prizes in question.
 And so the dragon mage had kept perfectly still throughout the chaos. He had forced himself to do
nothing when the party was attacked and the creatures of the forest stole him and Rhonin from under the
elves’ very eyes. Krasus sensed no malice in their rescuers, but that did not mean the pair might not come
to harm later. He had remained secretly vigilant throughout the forest journey, hoping he would be of
more aid than the last time.
 But when they had reached the sunlit opening, he had miscalculated. The face had appeared too swiftly,
breathed too unexpectedly upon him. Like Rhonin, Krasus had passed out.
 Unlike Rhonin, he had slept only minutes.
 He awakened to, of all things, a small red bird perched atop his robed knee. The gentle sight so startled
the dragon mage that he gasped, sending the tiny avian fleeing to the branches above.
 With great caution, Krasus surveyed his surroundings. To all apparent evidence, he and Rhonin lay in the
midst of a mystical glade, an area of immense magic at least as ancient as the dragons. That the sun shone
here so brilliantly, that the grass, flowers, and birds radiated such peace, was no accident. Here was the
chosen sanctum of some being whom Krasus should have known—but could not in the least recall.
 And that was a problem of which he had not spoken truthfully to his companion. Krasus’s memories
were riddled with gaps. He had recognized the night elves for what they were, but other things, many of
them mundane, had completely vanished. When he tried to focus on them, the dragon mage found
nothing but emptiness. He was as weak in his mind as he was in his body.
 But why? Why had he suffered so much more than Rhonin? While a human mage of impressive abilities,
Rhonin was still a fragile mortal. If anyone should have been battered and beaten by their madcap flight
through time and space, it should have rightly been the lesser of the two travelers.
 The moment he thought it, Krasus felt guilty. Whatever the reason for Rhonin surviving more, Krasus
only shamed himself by wishing for a reversal of their fortunes. Rhonin had nearly sacrificed himself for his
former mentor several times.
 Despite his tremendous weakness and lingering pain, he pushed himself to his feet. Of the creatures who
had brought them here, Krasus saw no sign. Likely they had returned to being a literal part of the forest,
tending to its needs until next summoned to action by their lord. That these had been the simplest of the
forest’s guardians Krasus was well aware. The night elves were a relatively paltry threat.
 But what did the power that ruled here want of two wayward wanderers?
 Rhonin still slumbered deep and, judging by his own reaction to the pollen, Krasus expected him to do
so for quite some time. With no evident threat in sight, he dared leave the human sleeping, choosing now
to investigate the boundaries of their freedom.
 The thick field of flowers surrounded the soft, open grass like a fence, with what appeared an equal
number pointed outward and inward. Krasus approached the closest section, watching the flowers
warily.
 As he came within a foot of them, they turned to face him, opening fully.
 Instantly the dragon mage stepped back…and watched as the plants resumed their normal appearance.
A simple, soft wall of effective guardians. He and Rhonin were safe from any danger outside while at the
same time they were kept from causing trouble for the forest.
 In his present condition, Krasus did not even consider leaping over the flowers. Besides, he suspected
that doing so would only unleash some other hidden sentry, possibly one not as gentle.
 There remained only one recourse. To better conserve his strength, he sat down and folded his legs.
Then, taking a deep breath, Krasus studied the surrounding glade one last time…and spoke to the air.
 “I would talk with you.”
 The wind picked up his words and carried them into the forest, where they echoed again and again. The
birds grew silent. The grass ceased waving.
 Then came the wind again…and with it the reply.
 “And so we shall talk…”
 Krasus waited. In the distance, he heard the slight clatter of hooves, as if some animal had chanced by at
this important moment. He frowned as the clatter grew nearer, then noticed a shadowy form coming
through the woods. A horned rider atop some monstrous steed?
 But then, as it drew up to the flowery guardians and the sun, ever shining, caught it full, the dragon in
mortal form could only gape like a mere human child at the imposing sight.
 “I know you…” began Krasus. “I know of you…”
 But the name, like so many other memories, would not come to him. He could not even say with any
certainty whether he had faced this mythic being before and surely that said something for the scope of
the holes in his mind.
 “And I know something of you,” said the towering figure with a torso akin to a night elf and a lower half
like that of a stag. “But not nearly as much as I would like…”
 On four strong legs, the master of the forest strode through the barrier of flowers, which gave way as
loyal hounds would to their handler. Some of the flowers and grass even caressed the legs gently,
lovingly.
 “I am Cenarius…” he uttered to the slight figure sitting before him. “This is my realm.”
 Cenarius…Cenarius…legendary connotations fluttered through Krasus’s tattered mind, a few taking
root but most simply fading back to nothing. Cenarius. Spoken of by the elves and other forest dwellers.
Not a god, but…almost. A demigod, then. As powerful in his own way as the great Aspects.
 But there was more, so much more. Yet, strive as he might, the dragon mage could not summon any of
it.
 His efforts must have shown on his face, for Cenarius’s stern visage grew more kindly. “You are not
well, traveler. Perhaps you should rest more.”
 “No.” Krasus forced himself up, standing tall and straight before the demigod. “No…I would speak
now.”
 “As you like.” The antlered deity tilted his bearded head to one side, studying his guest. “You are more
than what you seem, traveler. I see hints of night elven but also sense far, far more. Almost you remind
me of—but that’s not likely.” The huge figure indicated Rhonin. “And he is unlike any creature to be
found within or without my domain.”
 “We’ve come a long distance and are, frankly, lost, great one. We know not where we are.”
 To the mage’s surprise, this brought thundering laughter from the demigod. Cenarius’s laughter made
more flowers bloom, brought songbirds to the branches around the trio, and set into motion a soft spring
breeze that touched Krasus’s cheek like a lover.
 “Then youare from far off! Whereelse could you be, my friend? Where else could you be butKalimdor!”
 Kalimdor. That, at least, made sense, for where else would one find night elves in numbers? Yet
knowing where he and Rhonin had been deposited answered few other questions. “So I suspected, my
lord, but—”
 “I sensed an unsettling change in the world,” Cenarius interrupted. “An imbalance, a shifting. I sought out
its origin and location in secret…and while I did not find all I searched for…I was led to you two.” He
stepped past Krasus to once more study the slumbering Rhonin. “Two wanderers from nowhere. Two
lost souls from nothing. You are both enigmas to me. I would rather you had not been in the first place.”
 “Yet you saved us from captivity—”
 The forest lord gave a snort worthy of the most powerful stag. “The night elves grow more arrogant.
They take what does not belong to them and trespass where they are not wanted. It is their assumption
that everything falls under their domination. Although they did not quite intrude upon my realm, I chose to
make them do so in order to teach them a lesson in humility and manners.” He smiled grimly. “That…and
they made it simpler for me by bringing what I desired directly here.”
 Krasus felt his legs buckling. The effort to keep on his feet was proving monumental. With determination,
he stood his ground. “They, too, seemed to be aware of our sudden arrival.”
 “Zin-Azshari is not without its own abilities. It does, after all, overlook the Well itself.”
 The dragon mage rocked, but this time not because of weakness. In his last statement, Cenarius had said
two words that set fear into Krasus’s heart.
 “Zin…Zin-Azshari?”
 “Aye, mortal! The capital of the night elves’ domain! Situated at the very shores of the Well of Eternity!
You know not even that?”
 Disregarding the weakness he revealed to the demigod, Krasus dropped to the ground, sitting in the
grass and trying to drink in the staggering reality of the situation.
 Zin-Azshari.
 The Well of Eternity.
 He knew them both, even as perforated as his memory had become. Some things were of such epic
legend that it would have taken the complete eradicating of his mind for Krasus to have forgotten them.
 Zin-Azshari and the Well of Eternity. The first, the center of an empire of magic, an empire ruled by the
night elves. How foolish of him not to have realized that during their capture. Zin-Azshari had been the
focal point of the world for a period of centuries.
 The second, the Well, was the place of magic itself, the endlessly deep reservoir of power spoken of in
awed whispers by mages and sorcerers throughout the ages. It had served as the core of the night elves’
sorcerous powers, letting them cast spells of which even dragons had learned respect.
 But both were things of the past…thefar past. Neither Zin-Azshari nor even the wondrous and sinister
Well existed. They had long, long ago vanished in a catastrophe that—that—
 And there Krasus’s mind faltered again. Something horrible had happened that had destroyed the two,
had ripped the very world asunder…and for the life of him he could not recallwhat.
 “You are not yet recovered,” Cenarius said with concern.
 “I should have left you to rest.”
 Still fighting to remember, the mage responded, “I will be…I will be all right by the time my friend
awakens. We—we will leave as soon as we can and trouble you no longer.”
 The deity frowned. “Little one, you misunderstand. You are both puzzle and guest to me…and so long
as you remain the former, you will also remain the latter.” Cenarius turned from him, heading toward the
guarding flowers. “I believe that you need sustenance. It shall be provided shortly. Rest well until then.”
 Cenarius did not wait for any protest nor did Krasus bother with one. When a being such as the forest
lord insisted that they stay, Krasus understood that it would beimpossible to argue otherwise. He and
Rhonin were guests for as long as Cenarius desired…which with a demigod might be the rest of their
lives.
 Still, that did not worry Krasus so much as the thought that those lives could be very short indeed.
 Both Zin-Azshari and the Well had been destroyed in some monstrous catastrophe…and the more the
dragon mage pondered it, the more he believed the time of that catastrophe was rapidly approaching.

 “I warn you, my darling counselor, I adore surprises, but this one I expect to be quite, quite delicious.”
 Xavius but smiled as he led the queen by the hand into the chamber where the Highborne worked. He
had come to her with as much graciousness as he could command, politely pleading with her to join him
and see what his sorcerers had accomplished. The counselor knew that Azshara expected something
quite miraculous and she would not be disappointed…even if it wasnot what the ruler of the night elves
had in mind.
 The guards knelt as they entered. Although their expressions were the same as always, like Xavius, they,
too, had been touched. Everyone now in the chamber understood, save for Azshara.
 For her, it would be only a moment more before the revelation.
 She eyed the swirling maelstrom within the pattern, her tone dripping with disappointment. “It looks no
different.”
 “You must see it up close, Light of a Thousand Moons. Then you’ll understand what we have
achieved…”
 Azshara frowned. She had come without her attendants at his request and perhaps she now regretted
that. Nevertheless, Azshara was queen and it behooved her to show that, even alone, she was in
command of any situation.
 With graceful strides, Azshara stepped up to the very edge of the pattern. She first eyed the work of the
Highborne currently casting, then deigned to set her gaze upon the inferno within.
 “It still strikes me as unchanged, dear Xavius. I expected more from—”
 She let out a gasp and although the counselor could not see her expression completely, he made out
enough to know that Azshara now understood.
 And the voice he had heard before, the voice of his god, said for all to hear…
 I am coming…
 EIGHT
 The Ritual of the High Moon had been completed and now Tyrande had time for herself. Elune expected
dedication from her priestesses, but she did not demand that they give to her every waking moment. The
Mother Moon was a kind, loving mistress, which had been what first drew the young night elf to her
temple. In joining, Tyrande found some peace to her apprehension, to her inner conflicts.
 But one conflict would not leave her heart. Times had altered matters between her, Malfurion, and
Illidan. They were no longer youthful companions. The simplicities of their childhoods had given way to
the complexities of adult relationships.
 Her feelings for both of them had changed and she knew that they, too, felt differently about her. The
competition between the brothers had always been a friendly one, but of late it had intensified in a manner
Tyrande did not appreciate. Now it seemed that they battled each other, as if vying for some prize.
 Tyrande understood—even if they did not—thatshe was the prize.
 While the novice priestess felt flattered, she did not want either of them hurt. Yet, Tyrande would be the
one who would hurt at least one brother, for she knew in her heart that when it came time to choose her
life mate, it would be either Illidan or Malfurion.
 Dressed in the silver, hooded gown of a novice priestess, Tyrande hurried silently through the high,
marble halls of the temple. Above her, a magical fresco illustrated the heavens. A casual visitor might
have even thought that no roof stood here, so perfect was the illusion. But only the grand chamber, where
the rituals took place, was truly open to the sky. There, Elune visited in the form of moonbeams,
gloriously touching her faithful as a mother did her beloved children.
 Past the looming, sculpted images of the goddess’s earthly incarnations—those who had served in the
past as high priestess—Tyrande finally strode across the vast marble floor of the foyer. Here, in intricate
mosaic work, the formation of the world by Elune and the other gods was depicted, the Mother Moon of
course illustrated most dominantly. With few exceptions, the gods were vague forms with shadowed
faces, no mere flesh creature worthy of envisioning their true images. Only the demigods, children and
assistants to their superiors, had definite visages. One of those, of course, was Cenarius, said by many to
be perhaps the child of the Moon and the Sun. Cenarius, of course, said nothing one way or another, but
Tyrande liked to think that story the truth.
 Outside, the cool night air soothed her some. Tyrande descended the white alabaster steps and joined
the throngs. Many bowed their heads in deference to her position while others politely made a path for
her. There were advantages to being even an initiate of Elune, but at the moment Tyrande wished that she
could have simply been herself to the world.
 Suramar was not so glorious as Zin-Azshari, but it had a presence all its own. Bright, flashy colors filled
her gaze as she entered the main square, where merchants of all status plied their wares on the
population. Dignitaries in rich, diamond-sequined robes of sun red and fiery orange, their noses upward
and their eyes only on the path ahead, walked alongside low-caste elves in more plain garments of green,
yellow, blue, or some mix of the colors. In the market, everyone made an appearance in order to show
themselves off as best they could.
 Even the buildings acted as displays for their inhabitants, every color of the rainbow represented in the
view Tyrande had. Some businesses had been painted in as many as seven shades and most had
dramatic images splashed across every side. Torchlight illuminated most, the dancing flames considered a
lively accent.
 The few non-night elves whom the novice priestess had met during her short life seemed to find her
people garish, even daring to say that Tyrande’s race must be color-blind. While her own tastes tended
to be more conservative, albeit not so much as Malfurion’s, Tyrande felt that night elves simply
appreciated better the variety of patterns and shades that existed in the world.
 Near the center of the square, she noted a crowd gathered. Most gestured and pointed, some making
comments either of disgust or mockery. Curious, Tyrande went to see what could be of such interest.
 At first, the onlookers did not even notice her presence, certainly a sign that whatever they watched must
be a rare marvel. She politely touched the nearest figure, who upon recognition immediately stepped
aside for her. By this method, she managed to wend her way deep into the throng.
 A cage just slightly shorter than her stood in the midst of it all. Made of good strong iron bars, it
evidently held a beast of some strength, for it rattled harshly and now and then an animalistic growl set the
audience to renewed murmurs.
 Those directly in front of her would not move, not even when they discovered who had tapped them on
the shoulder. Frustrated and curious, the slim night elf shifted position, attempting to see between one
pair.
 What she beheld made her gasp.
 “What is it?” Tyrande blurted.
 “No one knows, sister,” replied what turned out to be a sentry standing duty. He wore the breast plate
and robes of one of Suramar’s Watch. “The Moon Guard had to spellcast it at least three times to bring
it down.”
 Tyrande instinctively glanced around for one of the hooded, green-robed wizards, but saw none. Likely
they had ensorcelled the cage, then left the secured creature in the hands of the Watch while they went to
discuss what to do with it.
 Butwhat had they left?
 It was no dwarf, although in some ways its build reminded her of one. Had it stood straight, it would
have been about a foot shorter than a night elf, but at least twice as broad. Clearly the beast was a
creature of brute strength, for never had she seen such musculature. It amazed Tyrande that even with
spells cast upon the cage the prisoner had not simply bent the bars aside and escaped.
 A high-caste onlooker suddenly prodded the stooped figure with his golden staff…which caused
renewed fury within. The night elf barely pulled his stick out of reach of the thick, meaty paws. The
creature’s squat, round-jawed face contorted as it snarled its anger. It likely would have managed to
snag the staff if not for the thick chains around its wrists, ankles, and neck. The heavy chains were not
only the reason it stayed stooped, but also why it could never deal with the bars, even supposing it had
the strength and resolve.
 From horror and disgust, Tyrande’s emotions shifted to pity. Both the temple and Cenarius had taught
her respect for life, even that which seemed at first only monstrous. The green-hided creature wore
primitive garments, which meant that it—orhe, in most probability—had some semblance of intelligence.
It was not right, then, that he be set up for show like some animal.
 Two empty brown bowls indicated that the prisoner had at least been given some sustenance, but from
his massive frame, the novice priestess suspected it was not nearly enough. She turned to the sentry. “He
needs more food and water.”
 “I’ve been given no orders for such, sister,” the sentry respectfully replied, his eyes ever on the crowd.
 “That shouldn’t require orders.”
 Tyrande was rewarded with a slight shrug. “The elders haven’t decided what to do with it yet. Maybe
they don’t think it’ll need any more food or drink, sister.”
 His suggestion repulsed her. Night elf justice could be very draconian. “If I bring some sustenance for
him, will you attempt to stop me?”
 Now the soldier looked uncomfortable. “You really shouldn’t, sister. That beast’s just as liable to tear
your arm off and gnaw on that instead of whatever fare you bring. You would be wise to leave it alone.”
 “I shall take my chances.”
 “Sister—”
 But before he could try to talk her out of it, Tyrande had already turned away. She headed directly for
the nearest food merchant, seeking a jug of water and a bowl of soup. The creature in the cage looked
fairly carnivorous, so she also decided upon a bit of fresh meat. The proprietor refused to charge her, a
benefit of her calling, so she gave him the blessing she knew he wanted, then thanked him and returned to
the square.
 Apparently already bored, much of the crowd had dissipated by the time Tyrande reached the center.
That, at least, made it easier for her to confront the prisoner. He glanced up as the novice priestess
approached, at first clearly marking her as just one more jaded gawker. Only when he saw what Tyrande
held did he take more interest.
 He sat up as best he could considering to be his chains, deep-set eyes warily watching her under the
thick, bushy brow. Tyrande judged him to be toward the latter half of his life, for his hair had grayed and
his brutish visage bore the many marks and scars of a harsh existence.
 Just beyond what she calculated to be his reach, the young night elf hesitated. Out of the corner of her
eye, Tyrande noted the sentry taking cautious interest in her actions. She understood that he would use
his spear to gut the creature if it made any attempt to harm her. Tyrande hoped it would not come to that.
It would be the most terrible of ironies if her intent to aid a suffering being led to its death.
 With grace and care, she knelt before the bars. “Do you understand me?”
 He grunted, then finally nodded.
 “I’ve brought you something.” She held out the bowl of soup first.
 The wary eyes, so different from her own, fixed upon the bowl. She could read the calculation in them.
Once they flickered ever so briefly in the direction of the nearest guard. The right hand closed, then
opened again.
 Slowly, ever so slowly, he stretched forth the hand. As it neared her own, Tyrande saw how huge and
thick it really was, massive enough to envelop both of hers without difficulty. She pictured the strength
inherent in it and almost pulled the offering back.
 Then with a gentleness that surprised her, the prisoner took the bowl from her grasp, placing it securely
in front of him and eyeing her expectantly.
 His acceptance made her smile, but he did not respond in kind. Slightly more at ease, Tyrande handed
him next the meat, then, lastly, the jug of water.
 When he had all three safely tucked near, the green-skinned behemoth began to eat. He swallowed the
contents of the bowl in one huge gulp, some of the brownish liquid spilling over his jaw. The piece of
meat followed, thick, jagged, yellow teeth ripping away at the raw flesh without hesitation. Tyrande
swallowed, but did not otherwise show her discomfort at the prisoner’s monstrous manners. Under such
conditions, she might have acted little better than he.
 A few onlookers watched this activity as they might have a minstrel act, but Tyrande ignored them. She
waited patiently as he continued to devour his meal. Away went every bit of meat on the bone, which the
creature then broke in two and sucked on the marrow with such gusto that the remainder of the
crowd—their fine sensibilities disturbed by the animalistic sight—finally left.
 As the last of them departed, he suddenly dropped the bone fragments and, with a startling deep
chuckle, reached for the jug. Not once had his eyes strayed from the novice priestess for more than a
second.
 When the water was gone, he wiped his wide mouth with his arm and grunted, “Good.”
 To hear an actual word startled Tyrande even though she had assumed earlier that if he understood, then
he could also speak. It made her smile again and even risk leaning against the bars, an act that at first
brought anxiety to the sentries.
 “Sister!” cried one of the guards. “You shouldn’t be so near! He’ll tear—”
 “He’ll do nothing,” she quickly assured them. Glancing at the creature, she added, “Will you?”
 He shook his head and drew his hands close to his chest as a sign. The sentries backed away, but
remained watchful.
 Ignoring them once more, Tyrande asked, “Do you want anything else? More food?”
 “No.”
 She paused, then said, “My name is Tyrande. I am a priestess of Elune, the Mother Moon.”
 The figure in the cage seemed disinclined to continue the conversation, but when he saw that she was
determined to wait him out, he finally responded, “Brox…Broxigar. Sworn servant to the Warchief
Thrall, ruler of the orcs.”
 Tyrande tried to make sense of what he had said. That he was a warrior was obvious by his
appearance. He served some leader, this Thrall. A name in some ways more curious than his own, for
she understood its meaning and therefore understood the contrary nature of a ruler so titled.
 And this Thrall was lord of the orcs, which Tyrande assumed must be what Brox was. The teachings of
the temple were thorough, but never had she heard there or anywhere else of a race called the orcs.
Certainly, if they were all like Brox, they would have been well remembered by the night elves.
 She decided to delve deeper. “Where are you from, Brox? How did you get here?”
 Immediately Tyrande realized that she had erred. The orc’s eyes narrowed and he clamped his mouth
shut. How foolish of her not to think that the Moon Guard had already questioned him…and without the
courtesy that she had shown so far. Now he must have thought that she had been sent to learn by
kindness what they had failed to gain by force and magic.
 Clearly desiring an end to their meeting, Brox picked up the bowl and held it toward her, his expression
dark and un-trusting.
 Without warning, a flash of energy coursed into the cage from behind the novice, striking the orc’s hand.
 With a savage snarl, Brox seized his burnt fingers, holding them tight. He glared at Tyrande with such a
murderous gaze that she could not help but rise and step back. The sentries immediately focused on the
cage, their spears keeping Brox pinned to the back bars.
 Strong hands seized her by the shoulders and a voice she knew well anxiously whispered, “Are you safe,
Tyrande? That foul beast didn’t hurt you, did he?”
 “He had no plans to do me any harm!” she blurted, turning to face her supposed rescuer. “Illidan! How
could you?”
 The handsome night elf frowned, his arresting golden eyes losing some of their light. “I was only fearful
for you! That beast is capable of—”
 Tyrande cut him off. “In there, he is capable of very little…and he is no beast!”
 “No?” Illidan leaned down to inspect Brox. The orc bared his teeth but did nothing that might otherwise
antagonize the night elf. Malfurion’s brother snorted in disdain. “Looks like no civilized creature to me…”
 “He was merely trying to hand back the bowl. And if there had been any trouble, the guards were
already standing by.”
 Illidan frowned. “I’m sorry, Tyrande. Maybe I overreacted. You must admit, though, that few others,
even among your calling, would have taken the terrible risk you did! You might not know this, but they
say that when he woke up, he almost throttled one of the Moon Guard!”
 The novice priestess glanced at the stone-faced sentry, who reluctantly nodded. He had forgotten to
mention that little tidbit to her. Still, Tyrande doubted it would have made a difference. Brox had been
mistreated and she had felt the need to come to his aid.
 “I appreciate your concern, Illidan, but again I tell you that I wasn’t in any danger.” Her gaze narrowed
as she took in the orc’s injury. The fingers were blackened and the pain in Brox’s eyes was obvious, yet
the orc did not cry out nor did he ask for any healing.
 Abandoning Illidan, Tyrande knelt again by the cage. Without hesitation, she reached through the bars.
 Illidan reached for her. “Tyrande!”
 “Stay back! All of you!” Meeting the orc’s baleful gaze, she whispered, “I know you didn’t mean me
any harm. I can mend that for you. Please. Just let me.”
 Brox growled, but in a manner that made her think he was not angry but simply weighing his options.
Illidan still stood next to Tyrande, who realized that he would strike the orc again at the slightest hint of
something gone awry.
 “Illidan…I’m going to have to ask you to turn away for a moment.”
 “What? Tyrande—”
 “For me, Illidan.”
 She could sense his pent-up fury. Nevertheless, he obeyed her request, spinning around and facing one
of the buildings surrounding the square.
 Tyrande eyed Brox again. His gaze had shifted to Illidan and for the briefest moment she read the
satisfaction in them. Then the orc focused on her and gingerly offered up the maimed hand.
 Taking it in her own, she studied the wound in shock. The flesh had been burned away in places on two
fingers and a third was red and festering.
 “What did you do to him?” she asked Illidan.
 “Something I learned recently,” was all he would say.
 It had certainly not been something he had learned in the forest of Cenarius. This was an example of high
night elven sorcery, a spell he had cast with scant concentration. It revealed how skilled Malfurion’s
brother could be when the subject excited him. He clearly enjoyed the manipulation of sorcery over that
of the more slow-paced druidism.
 Tyrande was not so certain she liked his choice.
 “Mother Moon, hear my entreaties…” Ignoring the aghast expressions of the guards, she took the orc’s
fingers and kissed each ever so gently. Tyrande then whispered to Elune, asking the goddess to grant her
the ability to ease Brox’s burden, to render whole what Illidan had, in his rashness, ruined.
 “Stretch your hand out as far as you can,” she ordered the prisoner.
 Watching the sentries, Brox moved forward, straining to thrust his brutish hand beyond the bars.
Tyrande expected some sort of magical resistance, but nothing happened. She supposed that since the
orc had done nothing to escape, the cage’s spellwork had not reacted.
 The novice priestess looked up into the sky, where the moon hovered just above. “Mother Moon…fill
me with your purity, your grace, your love…grant me the power to heal this…”
 As Tyrande repeated her plea, she heard a gasp from one of the guards. Illidan started to turn, but then
evidently thought better than to possibly upset Tyrande further.
 A stream of silver light…Elune’s light…encompassed the young priestess. Tyrande radiated as if she
were the Moon herself. She felt the glory of the goddess become a part of her.
 Brox almost pulled away, startled by the wondrous display. To his credit, though, he placed his trust in
her, letting her draw his hand as best she could into the glow.
 And as the moonlight touched his fingers, the burnt flesh healed, the gaps where bone showed through
regrew, and the horrific injury that Illidan had caused utterlyvanished.
 It took but a few scant seconds to complete the task. The orc remained still, eyes as wide as a child’s.
 “Thank you, Mother Moon,” Tyrande whispered, releasing Brox’s hand.
 The sentries each fell to one knee, bowing their heads to the acolyte. The orc drew his hand close,
staring at each finger and waggling them in astonishment. He touched the skin, first tenderly, then with
immense satisfaction when no pain jarred him. A grunt of pleasure escaped the brutish figure.
 Brox suddenly began contorting his body in the cage. Tyrande feared that he had suffered some other
injury only now revealed, but then the orc finished moving.
 “I honor you, shaman,” he uttered, now prostrating himself as best as his bonds allowed. “I am in your
debt.”
 So deep was Brox’s gratitude that Tyrande felt her cheeks darken in embarrassment. She rose and took
a step back.
 Illidan immediately turned and held her arm as if to steady her. “Are you all right?”
 “I am…it…” How to explain what she felt when touched by Elune? “It is done,” she finished, unable to
respond properly.
 The guards finally rose, their respect for her magnified. The foremost one reverently approached her.
“Sister, might I have your blessing?”
 “Of course!” The blessings of Elune were given freely, for the teachings of Mother Moon said that the
more who were touched by her, the more who would understand the love and unity she represented and
spread that understanding to others.
 With her open palm, Tyrande touched each sentry on the heart, then the forehead, indicating the
symbolic unity of thought and spirit. Each thanked her profusely.
 Illidan took her arm again. “You need some recuperation, Tyrande. Come! I know a place—”
 From the cage came Brox’s gruff voice. “Shaman, may this lowly one, too, have your blessing?”
 The guards started, but said nothing. If even a beast so politely requested a blessing by one of Elune’s
chosen, how could they argue?
 They could not, but Illidan could. “You’ve done enough for that creature. You’re practically wavering!
Come—”
 But she would not deny the orc. Pulling free from Illidan’s grasp, Tyrande knelt again before Brox. She
reached in without hesitation, touching the coarse, hairy hide and hard, deep-browed head.
 “May Elune watch over you and yours…” the novice priestess whispered.
 “May your ax arm be strong,” he returned.
 His peculiar response made her frown, but then she recalled what sort of life he must have lived. His
wish for her was, in its own odd way, a wish for life and health.
 “Thank you,” she responded, smiling.
 As Tyrande rose, Illidan once more interjected himself into the situation. “Now can we—”
 All at once she felt weary. It was a good weariness, though, as if Tyrande had worked long and hard for
her mistress and accomplished much in her name. She recalled suddenly how long it had been since she
had slept. More than a day. Certainly the wisdom of Mother Moon dictated that she return to the temple
and go to her bed.
 “Please forgive me, Illidan,” Tyrande murmured. “I find myself tired. I would like to return to my sisters.
You understand, don’t you?”
 His eyes narrowed momentarily, then calmed. “Yes, that would probably be best. Shall I escort you
back?”
 “There’s no need. I’d like to walk alone, anyway.”
 Illidan said nothing, only bowing slightly in deference to her decision.
 She gave Brox one last smile. The orc nodded. Tyrande departed, feeling oddly refreshed in her mind
despite her physical exhaustion. When it was possible, she would speak with the high priestess about
Brox. Surely the temple would be able to do something for the outcast.
 Moonlight shone on the novice priestess as she walked. More and more Tyrande felt as if she had
experienced something this night that would forever change her. Surely her interaction with the orc had
been the design of Elune.
 She could hardly wait to talk to the high priestess…

 Illidan watched Tyrande walk away without so much as a second glance at him. He knew her mind well
enough to understand that she still dwelled in the moment of her service for her goddess. That drowned
out any other influence, including him.
 “Tyrande…” He had hoped to speak with her of his feelings, but that chance had been ruined. Illidan
had waited for hours, watching the temple surreptitiously for her appearance. Knowing that it would not
look good for him if he joined her the moment she stepped out, he had waited in the background, intent
on pretending to just happen by.
 Then she had discovered the creature the Moon Guard had captured and all his well-thought plans went
awry. Now, not only had he lost his opportunity, but he had embarrassed himself in front of her, been
made to look the villain…and all because of athing like that!
 Before he could stop himself, words tumbled silently out of his mouth and his right hand flexed tightly.
 There was a shout from the direction of the cage. He quickly glanced toward it.
 The cage flared brightly, but not with the silver light of the moon. Instead, a furious red aura surrounded
the cell, as if trying to devour it…and its occupant.
 The foul creature inside roared in obvious pain. The guards, meanwhile, moved about in clear confusion.
 Illidan quickly muttered the counter words.
 The aura faded away. The prisoner ceased his cries.
 With no one watching him, the young night elf swiftly vanished from the scene. He had let his anger get
the best of him and lashed out at the most obvious target. Illidan was grateful that the guards had not
realized the truth, and that Tyrande had already left the square, missing his moment of rage.
 He was also thankful for those of the Moon Guard who had cast the magical barriers surrounding the
cage…for it was only those protective spells that had prevented the creature inside from beingslain.
 NINE
 They were dying all around him.
 Everywhere he looked, Brox saw his comrades dying. Garno, with whom he had grown up, who was
practically a brother, fell next, his body hacked to pieces by the screaming blade of a towering, fiery form
with a hellish, horned face full of jagged teeth. The demon itself was slain moments later by Brox, who
leapt upon it and, with a cry that made even the fearsome creature hesitate, cleaved Garno’s killer in two
despite its blazing armor.
 But the Legion kept coming and the orcs grew fewer. Barely a handful of defenders remained, yet every
minute another perished in the onslaught.
 Thrall had commanded that the way be blocked, that the Legion would not break through. Help was
being gathered, but the Horde needed time. They needed Brox and his fellows.
 But there were fewer and fewer. Duun suddenly dropped, his head bouncing along the blood-soaked
ground several seconds before his torso collapsed in a heap. Fezhar already lay dead, his remains all but
unrecognizable. He had been enveloped in a wave of unnatural green flame belched by one of the
demons, flame that had not so much burnt his body, butdissolved it.
 Again and again, Brox’s sturdy ax laid waste to his horrific foes, never seemingly the same kind of
creature twice. Yet, whenever he wiped the sweat from his brow and stared ahead, all he saw were
more.
 And more, and more…
 Now, only he stood against them. Stood against a shrieking, hungry sea of monsters hell-bent on the
destruction of everything.
 And as they fell upon the lone survivor—Brox awoke.
 The orc shivered in his cage, but not from cold. After more than a thousand repetitions, he would have
thought himself immune to the terrors his subconscious resurrected. Yet, each time the nightmares came,
they did so with new intensity, new pain.
 New guilt.
 Brox should have died then. He should have died with his comrades. They had given the ultimate
sacrifice for the Horde, but he had survived, had lived on. It was not right.
 I am a coward…he thought once more.If I had fought harder, I’d be with them.
 But even though he had told this to Thrall, the Warchief had shook his head and said, “No one fought
harder, my old friend. The scars are there, the scouts saw you battle as they approached. You did your
comrades, your people, as good a service as those who perished…”
 Brox had accepted Thrall’s gratitude, but never the Horde leader’s words.
 Now here he was, penned up like a pig waiting to be slaughtered for these arrogant creatures. They
stared at him as if he had grown two heads and marveled at his ugliness. Only the young female, the
shaman, had shown him respect and care.
 In her he sensed the power that his own people talked about, the old way of magic. She had healed the
fiery wound that her friend had caused him with but a prayer to the moon. Truly she was gifted and Brox
felt honored that he had been given her blessing.
 Not that it would matter in the long run. The orc had no doubt that his captors would soon decide how
to execute him. What they had learned from him so far would avail them nothing. He had refused to give
them any definitive information concerning his people, especially their location. True, he did not quite
know himself how to reach his home, but it was better to assume that anything said concerning that might
be hint enough for the night elves. Unlike those night elves who had allied themselves with the orcs, these
had only contempt for outsiders…and thus were a threat to the Horde.
 Brox rolled over as best as his bonds allowed. Another night and he would likely be dead, but not in the
manner of his choosing. There would be no glorious battle, no epic song by which to remember him…
 “Great spirits,” he muttered. “Hear this unworthy one. Grant me one last struggle, one last cause. Let me
be worthy…”
 Brox stared at the sky, continuing to pray silently. But unlike the young priestess, he doubted that
whatever powers watched over the world would listen to a lowly creature such as him.
 His fate was in the night elves’ hands.

 What brought Malfurion into Suramar, he could not quite say. For three nights he had sat alone in his
home, meditating on all Cenarius had told him, on all he himself had witnessed in the Emerald Dream.
Three nights and no answers to his growing concerns. He had no doubts that the spellwork continued in
Zin-Azshari and that the situation would only grow more desperate the longer no one acted.
 But no one else even seemed tonotice any problem.
 Perhaps, Malfurion finally decided, he had journeyed to Suramar simply to find some other voice, some
other mind, with which to discuss his inner dilemma. For that he had chosen to seek out Tyrande, though,
not his twin. She gave more care to her thoughts, whereas Illidan had a tendency to leap into action
regardless of whether or not he had hatched any plan.
 Yes, Tyrande would be good to talk with…and just to see.
 Yet, as he headed in the direction of the temple of Elune, a large contingent of riders suddenly bore
down from the other direction. Edging to the side of the street, Malfurion watched as several soldiers in
gray-green armor rushed by on their sleek, well-groomed panthers. Held high near the front of the party
was a square banner of rich purple with a black avian form at the center.
 The banner of Lord Kur’talos Ravencrest.
 The elven commander rode at the forefront, his mount larger, sleeker, and clearly the dominant female of
the pack. Ravencrest himself was tall, lanky, and quite regal. He rode as if nothing would deter him from
his duty, whatever that might be. A billowing cloak of gold trailed behind him and his high, red-crested
helm was marked by the very symbol of his name.
 Avian also best described his features, long, narrow, his nose a downward beak. His tufted beard and
stern eyes gave him an appearance of both wisdom and might. Outside of the Highborne, Ravencrest
was considered one of those with the most influence with the queen, who in the past had often taken his
counsel.
 Malfurion cursed himself for not having thought of Ravencrest before, but now was not a good
opportunity to speak with the noble. Ravencrest and his elite guard rode along as if on some mission of
tremendous urgency, which made Malfurion immediately wonder if his fears about Zin-Azshari had
already materialized. Yet, if that had been the case, he doubted that the rest of the city would have
remained so calm; the forces at play near the capital surely presaged a disaster of monumental
proportions, quickly affecting even Suramar.
 As the riders vanished, Malfurion moved on. So many people clustered into one area made the young
night elf feel a bit claustrophobic after his lengthy period in the forest. Still, Malfurion fought down the
sensation, knowing that soon he would see Tyrande. As anxious as she made him feel of late, she also
calmed his spirit more than anything else could, even his meditations.
 He knew he would have to see his brother, too, but the idea did not appeal to him so much this night. It
was Tyrande he wanted to see, with whom he wanted to spend some time. Illidan would still be there for
him later.
 Vaguely Malfurion noted a number of people crowded around something in the square, but his desire to
see Tyrande made him quickly ignore the scene. He hoped that she would be readily available and that
he would not have to go asking one acolyte after another. While the initiates of Elune were not bothered
by friends and relatives desiring to speak with one of them, for some reason Malfurion felt more anxious
about it than usual. It had little to do with his concerns about Zin-Azshari, either, and more to do with the
odd discomfort he now felt whenever he was near his childhood friend.
 As he entered the temple, a pair of guards surveyed him. Instead of robes, they wore gleaming, silver
breast plates and kilts, the former marked by a crescent moon design at the center. Like all of Elune’s
initiates, they were females and well versed in the arts of defense and battle. Tyrande herself was a better
archer than either Malfurion or Illidan. The peaceful teachings of the Mother Moon did not preclude her
most loyal children learning to protect themselves.
 “May we help you, brother?” the foremost guard asked politely. She and the other stood at attention,
their spears ready to turn on him at a moment’s warning.
 “I come seeking the novice priestess, Tyrande. She and I are good friends. My name is—”
 “Malfurion Stormrage,” finished the second, nearer to his age. She smiled. “Tyrande shares novice
chambers with myself and two others. I have seen you with her on occasion.”
 “Is it possible to speak with her?”
 “If she is finished with her meditation, then she should be free this hour. I will have someone ask. You
may wait in the Chamber of the Moon.”
 The Chamber of the Moon was the official title of the roofless center of the temple, where many of the
great rituals took place. When not in use by the high priestess, the temple encouraged everyone to make
use of its tranquil environment.
 Malfurion felt the touch of the Mother Moon the moment he entered the rectangular chamber. A garden
of night-blooming flowers bordered the room and in the center stood a small dais where the high
priestess spoke. The circular stone path leading to the dais was a mosaic pattern outlining the yearly
cycles of the moon. Malfurion had noted from his past few visits that no matter where the moon floated in
the heavens, its soft light completely illuminated the chamber.
 He strode to the center and sat on one of the stone benches used by initiates and faithful. Although eased
much by his surroundings, Malfurion’s patience quickly deteriorated as he waited for Tyrande. He also
worried that she might be displeased by his sudden appearance. In the past, they had always met only
after making prior arrangements. This was the first time that he had been so bold as to intrude without
warning into her world.
 “Malfurion…”
 For a moment, all his concerns vanished as he looked up and saw Tyrande step into the moonlight. Her
silver robes took on a mystical glow and in his eyes the Mother Moon could have looked no more
glorious a sight. Tyrande’s hair hung loose, draping her exquisite face and ending just above her
decolletage. The nighttime illumination emphasized her eyes and when the novice priestess smiled, she
herself seemed to light up the Chamber of the Moon.
 As Tyrande walked toward him, Malfurion belatedly rose to meet her. He was certain that his cheeks
flushed, but there was nothing he could do about it save hope that Tyrande did not notice.
 “Is all well with you?” the novice asked with sudden concern. “Has something happened?”
 “I’m fine. I hope I haven’t intruded.”
 Her smile returned, more arresting than ever. “You could never intrude upon me, Malfurion. In fact, I’m
very glad you’ve come. I wanted to see you, too.”
 If she had not noticed his darkening cheeks before, she certainly had to now. Nevertheless, Malfurion
pressed on. “Tyrande, can we take a walk outside the temple?”
 “If that makes you more comfortable, yes.”
 As they departed the chamber, he began, “You know how I said I’ve had some reoccurring dreams…”
 “I remember.”
 “I spoke with Cenarius about them after you and Illidan departed and we took measures to try to
understand why they keep repeating.”
 Her tone grew concerned. “And did you discover anything?”
 Malfurion nodded but held his tongue as they passed the two sentries and exited the temple. Not until
the pair had started down the outer steps did he continue.
 “I’ve progressed, Tyrande. Progressed far more than either you or Illidan realized. Cenarius showed me
a path into the world of the mind itself…the Emerald Dream, he called it. But it was more than that.
Through it…through it I was able to see the real world as I never had before…”
 Tyrande’s gaze shifted to the small crowd near the center of the square. “And what did you see?”
 He turned Tyrande to face him, needing her to understand utterly what he had discovered. “I saw
Zin-Azshari…and the Well over which it looks.”
 Leaving nothing out, Malfurion described the scene and the unsettling sensations he had experienced. He
described his attempts to understand the truth and how his dream self had been repulsed after attempting
to see exactly what had transpired with the Highborne and the queen.
 Tyrande stared wordlessly at him, clearly as stunned as he had been by his ominous discovery. Finding
her voice, she asked, “The queen? Azshara? Can you be certain?”
 “Not entirely. I never actually saw much inside, but I can’t imagine how such madness could go on
without her knowledge. True, Lord Xavius has great influence over her, but even she would never stand
by blindly. I have to think that she knows the risks they take…but I don’t think any of them understand
how terrible those risks are! The Well…if you could have felt what I had when I walked the Emerald
Dream, Tyrande, you would’ve feared as much as I did.”
 She put a hand on his arm in an attempt to comfort him. “I don’t question you, Malfurion, but we need
to know more! To claim that Azshara would put her subjects in danger…you have to tread lightly on
this.”
 “I thought to approach Lord Ravencrest on the subject. He, too, has influence with her.”
 “That might be wise…” Again her eyes moved to the center of the square.
 Malfurion almost said something, but instead followed her gaze, wondering what could constantly drag
her attention from his revelations. Most of those who had gathered had wandered away, finally revealing
to him what he had paid no mind to earlier.
 A guarded cage…and in it some creature not at all like a night elf.
 “What is that?” he asked with a growing frown.
 “What I wanted to talk withyou about, Malfurion. His name is Broxigar…and he’s unlike any being I’ve
ever heard or seen. I know your tale is important, but I want you to meet him now, as a favor for me.”
 As Tyrande led him over, Malfurion noticed the guards become alert. To his surprise, after a moment of
staring at his companion, they suddenly fell to one knee in homage.
 “Welcome again, sister,” uttered one. “You honor us with your presence.”
 Tyrande was clearly embarrassed by such respect. “Please! Please rise!” When they had obeyed, she
asked, “What news on him?”
 “Lord Ravencrest has assumed control of the situation,” answered another guard. “Even now he is out
inspecting the location of the capture in search of more evidence and possible incursions, but when he
returns, it’s said that he intends to interrogate the prisoner personally. That means that by tomorrow, it’s
likely the creature will be transported to the cells of Black Rook Hold.” Black Rook Hold was the walled
domain of Lord Ravencrest, a veritable fortress.
 That the guard was so free with his information surprised Malfurion until he realized how awed the
soldier was by Tyrande. True, she was an initiate of Elune, but something must have happened that made
her of particular importance to these soldiers.
 Tyrande looked perturbed by the revelation. “This interrogation…what will it entail?”
 The guard could no longer look at her directly. “It entails whatever satisfies Lord Ravencrest, sister.”
 The priestess did not press further. Her hand, which had lightly rested on Malfurion’s arm, momentarily
squeezed tight.
 “May we speak with him?”
 “For only a moment, sister, but I must ask you to speak so that we can hear you. You understand.”
 “I do.” Tyrande led Malfurion to the cell, where they both knelt.
 Malfurion bit back a gasp of astonishment. Up close, the hulking figure inside truly amazed him. He had
learned of many strange and unusual creatures during his time with Cenarius, but never had he been
taught of such a being as this.
 “Shaman…” it—he—muttered in a deep, rumbling…andpained voice.
 Tyrande leaned closer, obviously concerned. “Broxigar…are you ill?”
 “No, shaman…just remembering.” He did not explain further.
 “Broxigar, I’ve brought a friend with me. I’d like you to meet him. His name is Malfurion.”
 “If he’s your friend, shaman, I’m honored.”
 Shifting nearer, Malfurion forced a smile. “Hello, Broxigar.”
 “Broxigar is an orc, Malfurion.”
 He nodded. “I’ve never heard of an orc before.”
 The chained figure snorted. “I know of night elves. You fought beside us against the Legion…but
alliances fade in peace, it seems.”
 His words made no sense, yet they stirred within Malfurion a new anxiety. “How—how did you come to
be here, Broxigar?”
 “The shaman may call me Broxigar. To you…only Brox.” He exhaled, then stared intently at Tyrande.
“Shaman…you asked about me the last time and I wouldn’t tell. I owe you, though. Now I tell you what
I told these…” Brox made a derogatory gesture toward the nearby guards. “…and their masters, but
you’ll believe me no more than they did…”
 The orc’s tale began fantastic and grew even more so with each breath. He was careful not to speak of
his people or where they lived, only that at the command of his Warchief, he and another had journeyed
to the mountains to investigate an unsettling rumor. There they had found what the orc could only
describe as ahole in the world…a hole that swallowed all matter as it moved relentlessly along.
 It had swallowed Brox…and ripped his companion apart.
 And Malfurion, listening, began to relive his own sense of dread. Each new revelation by the orc fueled
that dread and more than once the night elf found himself thinking of the Well of Eternity and the power
drawn from it by the Highborne. Certainly the magic of the Well could create such a horrific vortex…
 But it could not be!Malfurion insisted to himself.Surely, this could have nothing to do with Zin-Azshari!
They aren’t that mad!
 Arethey?
 But as Brox continued, as he spoke of the vortex and the things he had seen and heard as he tumbled
through it, it be came harder and harder for Malfurion to deny the possibility ofsome link. Worse, without
knowing how it struck the night elf, the orc’s expression mirrored what Malfurion had felt when his astral
self had floated above the palace and the Well.
 “A wrongness,” the orc said. “A thing that should not be,” he added at another stage. These and other
descriptions struck Malfurion like well-honed daggers…
 He did not even realize when Brox’s tale ended, his mind swept up by the truth of it all. Tyrande had to
squeeze his arm to regain his attention.
 “Are you all right, Malfurion? You look as if chilled…”
 “I—I’m fine.” To Brox, he asked, “You told this—this story—to Lord Ravencrest?”
 The orc looked uncertain, but the guard responded, “Aye, that’s what he told, almost word for word!”
The soldier gave a harsh bark of a laugh. “And Lord Ravencrest believed it as little as you now! Come
the morrow, he’ll pull the truth from this beast…and if he has friends nearby, they’ll find us not so
tempting a target, eh?”
 So an invasion by orcs was all that Ravencrest suspected. Malfurion felt disappointed. He doubted that
the elven commander would see the possible link between his encounter and Brox’s tale. In fact, the
more he thought of it, the more Malfurion doubted Ravencrest would believe him at all. Here Malfurion
was, ready to tell the noble that their beloved queen might be involved in reckless spellwork with the
potential to bring disaster upon her people. The young night elf barely believed it himself.
 If only he had more proof.
 The guard began shifting anxiously. “Sister…I’m afraid I must ask you and your companion to depart
now. Our captain will be coming shortly. I really shouldn’t have—”
 “Quite all right. I understand.”
 As they started to rise, Brox moved to the front of the cell, one hand reaching toward Tyrande.
“Shaman…one last blessing, if you could grant it.”
 “Of course…”
 As she knelt again, Malfurion desperately pondered what he should do. Properly, any suspicions should
have been reported to Lord Ravencrest, but somehow that seemed a futile act.
 If only he could consult with Cenarius, but by then the orc might be—
 Cenarius…
 Malfurion glanced at Tyrande and Brox, a fateful decision coming to mind.
 Bidding the orc farewell, Tyrande rose again. Malfurion took her by the arm and the two thanked the
guard for their time. The young priestess’s expression grew perturbed as they left, but Malfurion said
nothing, his own thoughts still racing.
 “There must be something that can be done,” she finally whispered.
 “What do you mean?”
 “Tomorrow they will take him to Black Rook Hold. Once in there, he—” Tyrande faltered. “I’ve every
respect for Lord Ravencrest, but…”
 Malfurion only nodded.
 “I spoke with Mother Dejahna, the high priestess, but she says there is nothing we can do but pray for
his spirit. She commended me for my sympathy, but suggested I let matters take their course.”
 “Let them take their course…” Malfurion muttered, staring ahead. He gritted his teeth. It had to be done
now. There could be no turning back, not if his fears had any merit. “Turn here,” he suddenly
commanded, steering her down a side avenue. “We need to see Illidan.”
 “Illidan? But why?”
 Taking a deep breath and thinking of the orc and the Well, Malfurion simply replied, “Because we’re
going to let matters take their own course…with our guidance, that is.”
 * * *
 Xavius stood before the fiery sphere, staring into the gaping hole in its midst in rapt attention. Deep,
deep within, the eyes of his god stared back and the two communed.
 I have heard your pleas…he said to the counselor.And know your dreams…a world cleansed of the
impure, the imperfect. I would grant your desire, you the first among my faithful…
 His gaze never wavering, Xavius knelt. The other Highborne continued working their sorcery, trying to
expand upon what they had created.
 “You will come to us, then?” the night elf responded, artificial eyes flaring in anticipation. “You will come
to our world and make it so?”
 The way is not yet open…it must be strengthened…for it must be able to withstand my glorious
entrance…
 The counselor nodded his understanding. So magnificent, so powerful a force as the god would be too
much for the night elves’ feeble portal to accept. The god’s sheer presence would rip it asunder. It had to
be made larger, stronger, and more permanent.
 That his supposed deity could not perform this task himself, Xavius did not question. He was too caught
up in the wonder of his new master.
 “What can be done?” he pleaded. Try as they might, the Highborne sorcerers had reached the limits of
their knowledge and skills, Xavius included.
 I will send one of my lesser host to guide you…he may passthrough to your world…with effort…but
you must prepare yourselves for his coming…
 Almost leaping to his feet, the night elven lord commanded, “Let no one stumble in his efforts! We are to
be blessed with the presence of one of his favored!”
 The Highborne redoubled their efforts, the chamber crackling with raw, fearsome energy drawn directly
from the Well. Outside, the skies roared furiously and anyone looking upon the great black lake itself
would have turned their gaze away in fear.
 The fireball within the pattern swelled, the gap in the center opening like a wide, savage mouth. What
sounded like a million voices wailing filled the chamber, music to Xavius’s ears.
 But then one of the Highborne faltered. Fearing the worst, Xavius pushed himself into the circle, adding
his own might and skill to the effort. He would not fail his god! He would not!
 Yet, at first it seemed he and the rest would. The portal strained but did not grow. Xavius concentrated
the full force of his determination upon it, finally forcing the gap wider.
 And then…a wondrous, blinding light forced the assembled Highborneback. Despite their astonishment,
though, they somehow kept up their efforts.
 From deep within, an odd-looking form coalesced. At first it stood no more than a few inches tall, but as
it swiftly moved toward them, it grew…and grew…andgrew …
 The strain took its toll on more of the spellcasters. Two collapsed, one barely breathing. The others
teetered, yet, once again, under Xavius’s manic control, they regained power over the portal.
 Suddenly, the eerie cries of hounds shook them all. Only the counselor, with his eyes unnatural, saw
what first emerged from the gateway.
 The beasts were the size of horses and had low-set horns that curled down and forward. Their scaly
hides were colored a deathly crimson accented by savage splatterings of black and on their backs
fluttered a crest of wild, shaggy brown fur. They were lean but muscular hunters, each three-toed paw
ending in sharp claws more than half a foot long. Each creature had back legs slightly shorter than the
front, but Xavius had no doubt as to the beasts’ speed and agility. Even their slightest movements
suggested hunters well skilled in bringing down their prey.
 Atop their backs thrust two long, whiplike, leathery tentacles that ended in tiny sucker mouths. The
tentacles swayed back and forth, seeming to focus with eagerness on the assembled sorcerers.
 The face most resembled some peculiar cross between a wolf and a reptile. From the long, savage jaws
jutted scores of tall, sharp teeth. The eyes were narrow and completely white, but filled with a sinister
cunning that implied these were no mere animals.
 Then, from behind them stepped the towering figure of their master.
 He wore body armor of molten steel and in his huge, gauntleted hand he wielded a whip that flashed
lightning whenever used. His chest and shoulders, so much wider than the rest of his torso, dwarfed those
of even the mightiest warrior. Wherever the armor did not hide his form, pure flame radiated from his
scaled, fleshless, andunearthly body.
 Set deep in the broad shoulders, the flaming visage peered down at the night elves. That it most
resembled a brooding skull with huge, curled horns did nothing to dissuade the Highborne that here was a
heavenly messenger sent to aid them in their dream of a perfect paradise.
 “Know that I am the servant of your god…” he hissed, the flames that were his eyes flashing hot
whenever he spoke. “Come to help you open the way for his host and his mostglorious self!”
 One of the beasts howled, but a snap of the whip sent lightning crackling over the creature, instantly
silencing it.
 “I am the Houndmaster…” the massive, skeletal knight continued, fiery gaze fixing most upon the
kneeling counselor. “I amHakkar…”
